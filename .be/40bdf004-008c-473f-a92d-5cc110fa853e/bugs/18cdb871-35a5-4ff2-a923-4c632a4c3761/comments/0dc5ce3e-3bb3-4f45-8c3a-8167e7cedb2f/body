Hi,
I have in config.py:
blogdir = "/srv/http/dieterblog/"
py["log_file"] = os.path.join(blogdir, "logs", "pyblosxom.log")
py["log_level"] = "debug"

Also:
$ ls -alh /srv/http/dieterblog/logs
total 8.0K
drwxr-xr-x 2 http http 4.0K Oct 31 00:05 .
drwxr-xr-x 8 http http 4.0K Oct 31 00:05 ..
$ ps aux | grep light
root     12150  0.0  0.0   1600   236 pts/4    S    00:02   0:00 /usr/sbin/lighttpd-angel -D -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
http     12153  0.0  0.1   4340  1348 pts/4    S    00:02   0:00 /usr/sbin/lighttpd -D -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

In other words, the webserver has write permissions to write to the logs dir.
The directory /srv/http/dieterblog itself has the same permissions (755, owner/group http),
I created the logs dir (see above) myself as an attempt to make it work but this shouldn't be even needed.
However, no logs appear.
