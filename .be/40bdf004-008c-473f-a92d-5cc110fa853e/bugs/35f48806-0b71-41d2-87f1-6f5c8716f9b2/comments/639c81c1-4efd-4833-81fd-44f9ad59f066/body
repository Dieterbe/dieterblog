Hi,
when I change a setting such as the blog title in my config.py, the setting
doesn't have effect right away.  It seems to only work when I restart the web
server.  Note that I'm using lighttpd which talks over a socket to the
fastcgi process fcgi.py (included in this repo).
So this might be normal behavior.
However, it would be convenient to be able to make changes like these without
needing to restart the server.  Is there a way to force a reload or something?
