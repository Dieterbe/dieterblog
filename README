== INTRO ==

Branch: description:
* generated : exactly how a blog looks like, generated by `pyblosxom-cmd create dieterblog`
* manageable: like `generated`, but patched for easier deployment, and some helper scripts for fcgi/wsgi
* master: contains my personal modifications and blog content
* deploy: master + comments (don't go in master to protect user email addresses)
* private: master + additional things not ready for publication, like drafts
* tmp-generation: to commit output from drupal-to-pyblosxom into (except unpublished stuff, which goes in private)

== DEPENDENCIES ==
pyblosxom 1.5
python-flup

== NOTES ==
* change settings in config (like blog title) -> doesn't effect immediately? need to restart server?

== TODO ==
tags, comments, nice flavour
urls for html and feeds where you can enable/disable tags, i.e.:
	/*!irl for all topics minus things tagged irl
feeds for comments
show feed in html metadata
