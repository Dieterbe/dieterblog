== INTRO ==

Branch: description:
* generated : exactly how a blog looks like, generated by `pyblosxom-cmd create dieterblog`
* manageable: like `generated`, but patched for easier deployment, and some helper scripts for fcgi/wsgi
* master: contains my personal modifications and blog content
* deploy: master + comments (don't go in master to protect user email addresses)
* private: master + additional things not ready for publication, like drafts
* tmp-generation: to commit output from drupal-to-pyblosxom into (except unpublished stuff, which goes in private)

== DEPENDENCIES ==
pyblosxom 1.5 (packaged as pyblosxom-new or pyblosxom-git in AUR)
python-flup

== NOTES ==
* change settings in config (like blog title) -> doesn't effect immediately, need to restart server
  (deploy script takes care of it)

== TODO ==
* prevent other users of commenting as $my_nickname, "$myfirstname $mylastname", using *.$mydomain url or email
* is it possible to use comment titles? only show if non-empty/different from entry title?
* threading comments? like, reply to specific comment?
* do validation on comment submit form (show what is mandatory, if not good enough, show error and ask to correct)
  don't silently drop submission, but re-show
* implement magicwords.py
* allow in comments: ul, ol, li
* urls for html and feeds where you can enable/disable tags, i.e.:
  /*!irl for all topics minus things tagged irl
* feeds for comments
* show feed in html metadata, also when viewing only specific tag
* Google Analytics
