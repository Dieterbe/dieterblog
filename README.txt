## reviving the blog.

have not been able to update it for years.

here's what we know:
* the last real website update was december 10, 2016 (commit 0d728c8854608d2f426e9db176b2d7f86023b270) so it must have used a hugo version from december 2016 or older
  (i probably had not updated hugo for a while)
  - I think it was v0.16 from june 2016 but I'm not sure. (https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.16)
  - Could also have been https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.17 from october 2016, or anything pre 0.16
  - Probably nothing later, as v0.18 was only on december 19 (though it's possible i published that last post a few weeks after writing/committing it, but unlikely)

* public-real contains the website that is live right now (last updated in december 2016)
* I'm quite sure that public-real was generated with this command:
  ```
  hugo --config config-prod.toml -d public-real
  ```
  It is possible that 3 years ago i may have made manual tweaks inside public-real after generating it with hugo, though it seems unlikely
* Today, I want to revive my blog and be able to add new content to it.
  To be able to do this, i should first be able to regenerate public-real from the current content (not meaningfully updated since 2016 as can be seen in git history), using a recent version of hugo.

  **So this is our main objective: regenerating the site with a recent hugo (but possibly tweaked config file) should not meaningfully change "public-real"**
  I'm especially concerned about the RSS feed. I've had issues in the past (not with hugo) where subtle changes to the generated feed caused all content to re-appear fresh for all users. Want to avoid this from happening again. (I don't fully understand/remember how it happened. perhaps the post id's changed).


## attempts to revive

$ diff -r public-real public-prodcfg-master | wc -l

```
The diff is huge. There's some benign looking changes (whitespace) and more problematic ones.
Tip: `git diff` is easier to work with then `diff -r` so for analyzing I run `rm -rf public-real && mv public-prodcfg-master public-real` and then use the git tools.

* these files getting removed:
```
404.html
post/emulating_two-dimensional_(or_even_multi-dimensional)_arrays_in_bash/index.html
post/practical-fault-detection-redux-next-generation-alerting/index.html 
```
* a bunch of content missing in index.html
* lots of changes in markup and content
* tags now lower case in html titles and page titles (harmless)


I'm pretty sure in the past i've noticed problems around the "more" content divider

### other hugo versions
I have done some experiments in the past trying to build using a variety of hugo versions:
```
	public-prodcfg-v015/
	public-prodcfg-v016/
	public-prodcfg-v017/
	public-prodcfg-v050/
	public-prodcfg-v054/
```
and all of them showed big diffs with "public-real"

I haven't included these results yet because i need to validate them to see if they were generated from a pristine content directory, and i'm not sure how useful they will be. 
but I can go through this again if it helps at all.
