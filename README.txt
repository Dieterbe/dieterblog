reviving the blog. have not been able to update it for years.
here's what we know:
* the last real website update was december 2016 (commit 0d728c8854608d2f426e9db176b2d7f86023b270) so it must have used a hugo version from december 2016 or older
  (i probably had not updated hugo for a while)
* public-real contains the website that is live right now (last updated in december 2016)
