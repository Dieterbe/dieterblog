Hi there.
My name is Dieter Plaetinck. If that name seems weird, it's because I'm from Belgium.
<br/>
<br/>
I do backend/systems programming with a focus on performance and structured data processing.
I started at <a href="/tag/netlog">Netlog</a>, a large social network in Europe, which was a tremendous learning experience. But we lost the battle against Facebook.
Worked on the backend of <a href="/tag/vimeo">Vimeo</a> for a while, which was fun. I miss the weekly <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks">staff picks</a> screenings.
After spending a few fun years living in New York City, it was time for something else.
I joined <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> as first engineering hire, building our open source timeseries platform on top of which we're building the business from scratch.
Meanwhile I travel, work remotely, and officially reside in Malta.

Other hobbies: mountain biking and playing drums (though I haven't played in years).

Some people still know me from the <a href="/tag/uzbl">Uzbl</a> minimalist web browser or my work on the <a href="/tag/arch">Arch Linux installer and releases</a> or my <a href="http://stopabusingsiprefixes.org/">stop abusing SI prefixes</a> website.
