Hello! I am Dieter Plaetinck.
<br/>(yes, that's the correct spelling. I know. It's a Belgian name. Good luck pronouncing it :-)
<br/>
<br/>I do backend/systems engineering with a focus on performance, structured data analytics and <a href="/tags/monitoring/">monitoring</a>.
<br/>I started at <a href="/tag/netlog">Netlog</a>, a large social network in Europe, which was a tremendous learning experience. But we lost the battle against Facebook.
<br/>
Worked at <a href="/tag/vimeo">Vimeo</a> for a while which was fun. (upload and transcoding systems, analytics and monitoring). I miss the weekly <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks">staff picks</a> screenings.
<br/>
<br/>
After spending a few fun years living in New York City, it was time for something else.
<br/>I joined <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> as first engineering hire to work on Grafana's backend and later lead the development of our open source timeseries platform (<a href="https://grafana.com/oss/metrictank/">metrictank</a>), though nowadays GrafanaCloud is much broader and includes several projects. Grafana is a fantastic company that has opened new doors for me.  transparant, work-from-anywhere, open source, great people and in particular mature leadership that is growing our open source company in a sustainable way.
<br/>
<br/>
Some people still know me from the <a href="/tag/uzbl">Uzbl</a> minimalist web browser, my work on the <a href="/tag/arch">Arch Linux installer and releases</a>, the <a href="http://stopabusingsiprefixes.org/">stop abusing SI prefixes</a> website or the <a href="http://metrics20.org/">metrics 2.0</a> project.
<br/>
<br/>Other hobbies: mountain biking and playing drums (though I haven't played in years).
