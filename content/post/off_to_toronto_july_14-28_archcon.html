<p>As mentioned <a href="/uzbl_monitoring_aif_talks">earlier</a>, I'll be at <a href="http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/">Archcon in Toronto</a> in a few weeks.<br />
It's a very small conference, and the first of its kind.  At the <a href="/froscon_2009_afterthoughts">last FrOSCon</a> we have been playing with the idea to hold an informal Arch conference in Europe, but those were just ideas.  Dusty and Ricardo beat us with an actual implementation.<br />
This is great, and one of the milestones in Arch Linux history.  Which is why I want to be there and help making it better.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/?p=116">Archcon schedule</a>.  I'll be talking about AIF and uzbl.</p>
<p>My schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>wed. July 14: departure</li>
<li>July 14 - 21: hanging around in downtown Toronto. Not sure yet where I'll stay. probably some hostel.</li>
<li>July 21 - 28: bed and breakfast pretty close to the conference location, outside the city center</li>
<li>July 22 - 23 are the conference talks days, July 24-25 are the conference tourist days, where we'll do some touristy stuff with the conference participants</li>
<li>wed. July 28: flying back</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archcon_extra_activities">many things to do</a> in and around Toronto. We still need to make the planning, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls">Niagara Falls</a> are definitely on the list.</p>
<p>Finally, big thanks to <a href="http://www.elys.com/home/">Elysium Digital</a>, a technology oriented consulting company for legal matters. Apparently they use Arch Linux for many things: on the desktop, in the server room, and in the forensic lab.   They emailed me to propose sponsoring my plane tickets, and they did.</p>
