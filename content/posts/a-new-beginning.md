For close to a decade, I dedicated myself to building out Grafana Labs and subsequently took some personal time to recharge.
I came out of these experiences as a different person, and am ready to share a few things I learned.

First step is bringing my abandoned blog back to life:

* Rewrote the [about/bio](/about) and [projects](/projects) pages
* Switched from lighttpd to [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) (automagic https! wow!)
* Enabled Google Cloud CDN
* Switched from Google Analytics to the open source [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)
* Tried [CloudFlare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) for comment spam prevention, but it's quite complicated and has un-googleable error codes, so i switched to something more simplistic
* Upgraded [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from 0.15 to 0.122 with very few breaking changes (!) and found a nice new [minimalist theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome/)
* I took more care than probably necessary to avoid accidental republishing of articles in RSS feeds, since that's such an easy mistake to happen with rss GUID's.


I don't know who still reads this blog, but if you do, stay tuned for more!
