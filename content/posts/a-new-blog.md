For nearly a decade, while I dedicated myself to building out Grafana Labs and subsequently took some personal time to recuperate from said dedication, this blog has withered through neglect.  I came out of these experiences as a different person, and am ready to share a few things I learned.

Meanwhile, I have also started some new projects I'ld like to share.

Updated [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to the latest version, found a [new theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome/), let's go.
