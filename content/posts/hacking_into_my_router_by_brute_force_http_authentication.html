<p>I forgot the username and password to access the web panel of my router.<br />
Luckily I knew some possible usernames and some patterns that I could have used to construct my password, so I just had to try all the combinations... Too much work to do manually but easily done when scripted.</p>
<p>Here is the php script that I came up with.  (obviously stripped of my personal stuff).  It got my account in less then a second :)</p>
