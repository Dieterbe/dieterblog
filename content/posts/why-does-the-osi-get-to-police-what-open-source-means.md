From the book [Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/)

*Who gets to say exactly what a term means, or doesn't mean?  Today, the word "literally" means its opposite, and what is DevOps anyway?*

When communities form and evolve along with the world around them, inevetably incompatible viewpoints emerge and can cause fractions. This was as true in the 1990's as it is in the 2020's.

Back in 1998, there was a community of folks (or perhaps just a duo) who felt that the verbiage at the time (Free Software) had become too much of a philosophical movement. (note: the Free Software Foundation was founded 13 years prior, in 1985, and informal use of "free software" had around since the 1970's)
They felt they needed a new word "to market the free software concept to people who wore ties". ([source](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/perens.html))
(somewhat ironic since today many of us like to say "Open Source is not a business model")

Bruce Perens - a Debian developer - had authored the first [Debian Free Software Free Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines) in 1997 which was turned into the first [Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) when he founded the [OSI](https://opensource.org) (Open Source Initiative) with Eric Raymond in 1998.

Eric Raymond is of course known for his seminal 1999 essay on development models ["The cathedral and the bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar), but he also worked on [fetchmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetchmail) among others.

> At the time of its conception there was much criticism for the Open Source campaign, even among the Linux contingent who had already bought-in to the free software concept. Many pointed to the existing use of the term "Open Source" in the political intelligence industry. Others felt the term "Open" was already overused. Many simply preferred the established name Free Software. I contended that the overuse of "Open" could never be as bad as the dual meaning of "Free" in the English language--either liberty or price, with price being the most oft-used meaning in the commercial world of computers and software

From [Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution: The Open Source Definition](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/perens.html)

It seems that even at the time, there was criticism, but only to the term "Open" in general and to "Open Source" only in a completely different industry.

Were there other voices who opposed OSI's definition of "Open Source"? Hard to know for sure, but I'm not aware of any.  
Was the term already being used in the software industry for other purposes?  Hard to know for sure, but seems unlikely.

With the evidence we have today, it seems fair to say Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens were leading, if not authorative, voices within the community.
Since then





Is that enough though? It isn't.  You cannot legally stop someone from using a word.  However, if you have a trademark, you can seek legal repercussions, which is a strong incentive for others not to misuse your mark.  Unfortunately, the OSI never succeeded in obtaining the trademark.  [As they explain](https://opensource.org/pressreleases/certified-open-source.php) the term was too widely adopted even already in 1999, rendering OSI (or anyone else) unable to claim ownership of it.


Today the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) is still maintained on the OSI website.


Since then, OSI has amassed goverment influence and industry partners.

As far as I'm aware, the Open Source definition has never really been challenged, until since about 2019 when MongoDB sought OSI approval for its SSPL license (and failed to secure it).
Since then, several companies have followed suit and adopted various new licenses with similar commercial non-compete clauses. The non-OSI compliance has led to new terms such as source available, Fair Code and [Fair Source](/posts/fair-source)





Scott Chacon, cofounder of GitHub has suggested [redefining "open source"](https://x.com/chacon/status/1754883687668232334) but I think that would be tremendously impractical. Much easier to just coin and promote a new term.



A suggestion such as [redefining "open source" to mean "i can look at this code on GitHub"](https://x.com/chacon/status/1754883687668232334) seems such an extreme move to me, as it doesn't consider any further terms and conditions about redistribution, right to modify, non-discrimination, etc; and would shake up well understood principles across the entire industry. It would create a lot more pain than it would solve.


In conclusion, the OSI is as authentic and credible as it gets, the open source definition has been widely accepted in the global community and industry, and the EU and US governments, which it collaborates with.  However, they cannot legally police the term "Open Source", but trying to change it now is incredibly impractical and pointless since there are plenty of other terms to choose from, such as Source Available or [Fair Source](/posts/fair-source).
