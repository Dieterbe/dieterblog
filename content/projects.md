Some interesting projects I've worked on, roughly in order from more recent (top) to old (bottom)

* [Tapas](https://tapas.fit): an open source self-improvement app, written in Flutter and dart.
* [Grafana OnCall Mobile app](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/06/12/on-call-management-on-the-go-introducing-the-grafana-oncall-mobile-app/) my first time building mobile apps, using Flutter and dart.
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir). If you like high performance data systems, both are fascinating, albeit complex Golang codebases.  I only contributed to the new sparse histograms, and support for out of order ingestion.
* [Metrictank](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank): Grafana's first metrics database.  Interesting Go distributed system, but eventually replaced by Mimir.
* [Carbon-relay-NG](https://github.com/grafana/carbon-relay-ng/): Golang data pipeline tool. Always wanted to rewrite it to be more performant, but never got around to it.
* [Graph-Explorer](https://vimeo.github.io/graph-explorer/) Dynamic Graphite dashboarding tool with query input. People liked the power, hated the UX - rightfully so. Grafana has a 100x better UX.
* [metrics2.0](http://metrics20.org): a loose set of ideas to enrich and standardize metrics. Did not go so well.
* [Uzbl](/tags/uzbl) minimalist browser inspired by vi and the unix philosophy. 
* I worked on the [AIF Arch Linux installer and release images](/tags/arch) for a few years.
* [Stop abusing SI prefixes website](http://stopabusingsiprefixes.org/). Because 1024 just ain't 1000.
