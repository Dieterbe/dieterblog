<p>At work, we've setup the <a href="http://netlog.com/go/developer">Netlog Developer Pages</a></p>
<p>It is the place where you can/will find all information around our OpenSocial implementation, our own API, skin development, sample code and so on.<br />
We've also launched a <a href="http://en.netlog.com/go/developer/group">group</a> where you can communicate with fellow developers and Netlog employees.<br />
The page also features a <a href="http://en.netlog.com/go/developer/blog">blog</a> where you can follow what is going on in the Netlog Tech team.</p>
<p>PS: We've also updated our <a href="http://en.netlog.com/go/inside/view=jobs">jobs page</a></p>
