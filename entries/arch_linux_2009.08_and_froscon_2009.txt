<p>So, the Arch Linux <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=77680">2009.08 release</a> is now behind us, nicely on schedule.<br />
I hope people will like <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/aif/">AIF</a> because it was a lot of work and we didn't receive much feedback.  I personally like it to apply my <a href="http://dieter.plaetinck.be/rethinking_the_backup_paradigm_a_higher-level_approach">fancy backup restoration</a> approach.<br />
But I'm sure if more people would look at the code we would find quite some design and implementation things that could be improved.  (With <a href="http://dieter.plaetinck.be/uzbl_a_browser_that_adheres_to_the_unix_philosophy">uzbl</a> I was amazed how much difference it can make if many people all have ideas and opinions about every little detail)</p>
<p>Later this week I'm off to the <a href="http://www.countingcows.be/home.php">Counting Cows festival</a> in France, and the week after that (august 22-23) I'm going to <a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon</a> in Germany where I will meet some of my Arch Linux colleagues in real life, which I'm really looking forward to.</p>
<p>If anyone wants a ride to froscon let me know.  But note I'll try to maximize my time there (leave saturday early and come back late on sunday.  I even took a day off on monday so I might stay a day longer if I find more interested people to hang out there)</p>
