<p>Apologies for only informing you about the second article now.  I assumed most of you follow LWN (you probably should) or found the article anyway.<br />
Of all the <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/press">articles</a> written about uzbl, no one came close to the quality of Koens work.  So even though it's a bit dated it's still worth a read.</p>
