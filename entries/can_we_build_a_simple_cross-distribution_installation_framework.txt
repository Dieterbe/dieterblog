Today at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/">Fosdem 2011</a> I did my talk <a href="http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall">Can we build a simple, cross-distribution installation framework?</a>
Basically, using the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> Installation Framework as a starting point, along with the notion that most of the code is actually not Arch-specific I adressed other distros to check
if there was any interest in sharing workload on the distribution-agnostic aspects of the framework. If other distros with a similar philosophy of little-abstractions/KISS would join, we would all reap the benefits of a simple, yet quite featureful installer.
There was some interest, so we'll see what happens.
