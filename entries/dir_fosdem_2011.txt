On February 4, I'll be in Amsterdam at <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/dir2011/cfp.html">DIR 2011</a>, the 11th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop.
After that, I'm going to the devopsdinner and Fosdem beer event in Brussels.
On february 5/6 of course, Fosdem itself.  Looking forward to the systemd talk.
On sunday I'll do a talk about <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall">simple shell based Gnu/Linux installers</a>,
like mentioned earlier I hope devs from other "lightweight"/kiss-style distro's will be present (Gentoo and other *too's, Crux, *ppix, ... You know who you are)
It would be interesting to share some common codebase for distribution independent topics (like filesystems), or at least discuss how feasible it would be.
