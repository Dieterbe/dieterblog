I found the Dvcs-autosync project on the <a href="http://lists.madduck.net/listinfo/vcs-home">vcs-home</a> mailing list,
which btw is a great list for folks who are doing stuff like maintaining their home directory in a vcs.
<br/>In short:
<ul>
<li>simple python tool (600 sloc), works with your dvcs of choice (mainly tested/used with git)</li>
<li>watches for inotify events, performs commits on changes (coalesces some changes together)</li>
<li>synchronizes with other clones (remotes), uses xmpp for push notifications</li>
<li>let's you know what's going on through libnotify popups or whatever</li>
<li><a href="http://mayrhofer.eu.org/dvcs-autosync">home page: http://mayrhofer.eu.org/dvcs-autosync</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gitorious.org/dvcs-autosync/dvcs-autosync">dvcs-autosync gitorious repo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lists.madduck.net/pipermail/vcs-home/2011-March/000314.html">initial announcement on vcs-home</a></li>
</ul>
Use cases:
<!--break-->
<ul>
<li>you have one or more trees you want to maintain under a VCS (because you want vcs advantages like history and whatnot) but it's not worth to spend time comitting manually</li>
<li>you want to backup some files transparently</li>
<li>you want to share / work with others easily</li>
<li>you like the idea of dropbox, but not the closed-source-ness or the vendor dependence</li>
<li>you work mainly with relatively small files (or.. read on)</li>
</ul>
Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>very simple to get started</li>
<li>simpler (and imho saner) code and implementation in comparison to <a href="http://sparkleshare.org/">sparkleshare</a></li>
<li>bound to the limitations of the dvcs. In case of git: no support for ownership, xattrs, and less suited for bigger files (although <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> might help?)</li>
<li>You cannot store a git repo inside a git repo, I think (i.e. I don't think you can keep a -potentially dirty- git clone in dvcs-autosync)</li>
<li>For a real, filesystem-level dropbox-alike <a href="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">coda</a> might be a better option, though I'm not sure how useful that project is right now</li>
</ul>

If it sounds like something you need, try it out.  And contributions welcome.
<br/>Next up to the todolist: more clever heuristic for event coalescing, setting up bugtracker.
