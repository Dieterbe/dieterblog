The discipline of collecting infrastructure & application performance metrics, aggregation, storage, visualizations and alerting has many terms associated with it...  Telemetry. Insights engineering.  Operational visibility.
I've seen a bunch of people present their work in advancing the state of the art in this domain:  
<br/>from <a href="http://mabrek.github.io/">Anton Lebedevich's statistics for monitoring series</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/95069158">Toufic Boubez' talks on anomaly detection</a> and Twitter's work on <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/breakout-detection-in-the-wild">detecting mean shifts</a> to projects such as <a href="http://flapjack.io/">flapjack</a> (which aims to offload the alerting responsibility from your monitoring apps), the <a href="http://metrics20.org/">metrics 2.0 standardization effort</a> or <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2013/06/11/introducing-kale/">Etsy's Kale stack</a> which tries to bring interesting changes in timeseries to your attention with minimal configuration.
<br/>
<br/>

Much of this work is being shared via conference talks and blog posts, especially around anomaly and fault detection, and I couldn't find a location for collaboration, quicker feedback and discussions on more abstract (algorithmic/mathematical) topics or those that cross project boundaries.  So I created the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/it-telemetry">IT-telemetry</a> Google group.  If I missed something existing, let me know.  I can shut this down and point to whatever already exists.  Either way I hope this kind of avenue proves useful to people working on these kinds of problems.
