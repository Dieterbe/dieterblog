On Arch Linux, and probably <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linux-distributions-to-include-run-directory-1219006.html">many other distros</a> /run is a new tmpfs, and /var/run symlinks to it.
With Lighttpd you might have a fastcgi socket defined something like "/var/run/lighttpd/sockets/mywebsite.sock".
This won't work anymore as after each reboot /var/run is an empty directory and lighttpd won't start, /var/log/lighttpd/error.log will tell you:
<pre>
2012-03-16 09:21:34: (log.c.166) server started 
2012-03-16 09:21:34: (mod_fastcgi.c.977) bind failed for: unix:/var/run/lighttpd/sockets/mywebsite.sock-0 No such file or directory 
2012-03-16 09:21:34: (mod_fastcgi.c.1397) [ERROR]: spawning fcgi failed. 
2012-03-16 09:21:34: (server.c.945) Configuration of plugins failed. Going down.
</pre>
That's where this new tool <a href="https://www.google.be/#hl=nl&q=tmpfiles.d">tmpfiles.d</a> comes in.
It creates files and directories as described in the configs, and gets invoked on boot.  Like so:
<code lang="bash"><![CDATA[
$ cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/lighttpd.conf 
d /run/lighttpd/sockets 0700 http http
]]>
</code>
