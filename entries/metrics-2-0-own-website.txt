Metrics 2.0 started as a <a href="http://dieter.plaetinck.be/metrics_2_a_proposal.html">half-formal proposal</a> and an implementation via <a href="http://vimeo.github.io/graph-explorer/">graph-explorer</a>, but is broad enough in scope that it deserves its own website, its own spec, its own community.  That's why I launched <a href="http://metrics20.org/">metrics20.org</a> and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metrics20">discussion group</a>.

      We have pretty good storage of timeseries data, collection agents, and dashboards.  But the idea of giving timeseries a "name" or a
      "key" is profoundly limiting us.  Especially when they're not standardized and missing information.
      <br/>Metrics 2.0 aims for <b>self-describing</b>, <b>standardized</b> metrics using <b>orthogonal tags</b> for every dimension.
      "metrics" being the pieces of information that point to, and describe timeseries of data.
      </p>By adopting metrics 2.0 you can:
      <ul>
        <li>increase compatibility between tools</li>
        <li>get immediate understanding of metrics</li>
        <li>build graphs, plots, dashboards and alerting expressions with minimal hassle</li>
      </ul>
