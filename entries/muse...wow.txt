<p>Weird as it might sound, I've never bothered to listen to Muse songs.. until now.  Some people have recommended the band to me so I really had to stop ignoring this band someday.  And wow.. what have I been missing al that time :/<br />
Songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTd6nyHuPdw">Butterflies and Hurricanes</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4R84e1HqvU">Citizen Erased</a> are among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard now.</p>
