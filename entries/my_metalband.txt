<p>Since the audience of this blog is largely technical, I don't post much about other topics, but I feel it's time for a short summary about one of my "real life projects".
<br/>In the spring of 2009 I joined a progressive death metal band.  I've been drumming since I was 17, but during the last 2 years I've been practising and rehearsing like never before.[1]
<br/>When you hear yourself on tape for the first time, it's a bit of disillusionment as you suddenly hear every imperfection, many of which you didn't realise you had (or didn't think were very noticeable).
<br/>So 2 years of practicing, rehearsing, test recordings, real recordings, mixing sessions (where you really grow a good ear towards imperfections) later we are now getting to the point where we can nail our stuff and are looking very forward to our first gig, which will be June 3rd in <a href="http://www.jhsjatoo.org/">jh sjatoo</a> in Kalken.
We've written about 7 songs, of which at this point we play 5. I wish we had proper recordings of all of them, but "Total Annihilation" captures several aspects of our style:

<br/>In early 2010 I treated myself (found a nice 2nd hand deal) to a new pdp birch kit with Zildjian Z custom cymbals (that was actually at the time I was in the <a href="/not_working_for_facebook.html">interview process for a Palo-Alto position at Facebook</a> so I might have needed to sell it again soon after, but that didn't happen).
