<p>I've put my (somewhat interesting) projects on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.<br />
Git is a damn cool VCS for distributed development, and I think Github integrates with it really nicely, adding some useful aspects for following and collaborating on projects.<br />
The projects I have migrated to my <a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe">GitHub profile</a> are:<!--break--></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe/ddm/tree">DDM</a>.  I've been doing quite some changes on this one lately, I hope to stabilize &amp; push soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe/tracks/tree">Tracks</a>.  This is an unofficial fork with my changes to the Tracks GTD tool. (mainly adding support for the GTD collecting and processing phases).  Still a work in progress.  Maybe someday it will be integrated.. we'll see.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe/phpdeliciousclient/tree">PHPDeliciousclient</a>.  This one I mainly added for convenience.  I don't really need to work on it anymore, but it could be useful for others...</li>
</ul>
<p>(I've also updated the "Projects" menu on this site)</p>
