<p>While setting up Zenoss and reading <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-status-variables.html">Mysql documentation about status variables</a> I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>All select_* variables ("Select statistics" graph in Zenoss) are actually about joins, not (all) selects.  This also explains why there is no clear relation to com_select (which shows the amount of selects).  ("Command statistics:selects" graph in Zenoss)</li>
<li>Com_select does not denote all incoming select commands.  If you have a hit on your query cache, com_select is <em>not</em> incremented.  So I thought we were doing less qps while in fact we were just getting more cache hits. Qcache_hits gets incremented on cache hits (but is not monitored by Zenoss)</li>
</ul>
