Opening files automatically on mainstream Linux desktops

<p>Xfce/Gnu/Linux works amazingly well on my moms workstation, with one exception: opening files automatically with the correct program.</p>
<p>The two biggest culprits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gtk's "open file with" dialog: if any Gtk program doesn't know how to open a file it brings up this dialog that is horrible to use.  You can search through your entire VFS for the right executable.  No thumbnails, no usage of .desktop files, $PATH, autocompletion and not even limiting the scope to directories such as /usr/bin</li>
<li>Mozilla software such as Firefox and Thunderbird: they only seem to differentiate files by their mimetype, not by extension.  There are add-ons to make it easier to edit these preferences, but eventually you're in a dead end because you get files with correct extensions but unuseful mimetimes (application/octet-stream)</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily the fd.o guys have come up with <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html">.desktop files</a>.<!--break--><br />
In $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/defaults.list you can define which applications to use for which mime type.<br />
So the only thing you need to do is call <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html">xdg-open</a> to open a file with the application you want.<br />
And that's exactly what I did. For now I just configure everything to use xdg-open and that seems to work just fine.  Oddly enough, even though the defaults.list is also based on mimetypes, files that are marked as octet-stream in Thunderbird seem to be properly recognized by xdg-open and opened with the correct program.  Or maybe this is because at the time of testing I only had octet-stream .doc files.  Anyway, we'll see.  But for now it's looking pretty good. </p>
<p>Note: somewhat related and also not very pleasant: epdfview used to say 'encrypted document.. please enter password' whenever you tried to open a non-existent file, a directory,.. basically anything else then a pdf file.  But this seems to be fixed since <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=508969">5 days ago</a>.</p>
