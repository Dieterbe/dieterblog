Restoring ssh connections on resume

<p>I use <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pm-utils">pm-utils</a> for hibernation support.<br />
It has a hooks system which can execute stuff upon hibernate/suspend/thaw/resume/..., but they run as root.<br />
If you want to run stuff as a regular user you could do something like</p>
<code lang="bash"><![CDATA[
su $user -c <command>
]]></code><p>..but these commands have no access to your user environment.<br />
In my user environment I have a variable which I need access to, namely SSH_AUTH_SOCK, which points to my agent which has some unlocked ssh keys.  Obviously you don't want to reenter your ssh key passwords everytime you resume.<br />
(In fact, I started using hibernate/resume because I got tired of having to enter 4 passwords on boot. - 1 for dm_crypt, 1 for login, 2 for ssh keys, not because it is much faster)</p>
<p>The solution is very simple. Use this:</p>
<code lang="bash"><![CDATA[
sudo pm-hibernate && do-my-stuff.sh
]]></code><p>This way, do-my-stuff.sh will be executed when you resume, after the complete environment has been restored.<br />
Ideal to kill old ssh processes, and setup tunnels and ssh connections again.<br />
I'm probably gonna integrate this into my <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/microde">microDE</a></p>
