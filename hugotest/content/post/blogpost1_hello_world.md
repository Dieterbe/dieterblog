I already wanted to get this up for a long time.  My initial idea was writing (and styling) it all from scratch using the marvelous <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> framework along with an authentication system i wrote, <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/147">dAuth</a>.<br />

However, due to my lack of time I decided to use the excellent <a href="http://www.drupal.org">drupal</a> platform, of which I'm quite sure will get the job done equally well, while drastically liberating my time, so I can invest it in other projects :-)<br />

<a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries Buytaert</a>'s talk on <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/">fosdem</a> this year really helped on making that decision ;-)</p>

<p>So, what will this site be about?</p>

<ul>

<li>me</li>

<li>my interests

<ul>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">Free &amp; Opensource software</a>, and the thoughts/ideals behind it</li>

<li>PHP scripting/programming (I like C(++), bash and j2se too but I'm not as good at it as I am at php)</li>

<li>Audio recording/mixing/production</li>

<li>Drumming, one of my greatest hobbies</li>

<li>Music, bands, movies,... I like</li>

<li>productivity (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, automation scripts, shell/DE tweaks, ...)

<li>ethics and philosophy, these aspects are really important in my life</li>

<li><a href="http://www.jhsjatoo.org/">Jeugdhuis SjaTOo</a>, our local youth club</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Now let's get started ;-)</p>
