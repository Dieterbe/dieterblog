<p>Right now, all the basics seem to work (except "Autostart Of Applications After Mount" of the spec).<br />

It's probably not bugfree.  I hacked it together in a few hours (but it works for me :-).   Bugreports welcome!<br />

<p>Oh and btw: I got rid of Xfce too.  I realized that all I needed anyway is a good WM (for which I use compiz fusion), an application starter (I still haven't figured out if I prefer <a href="http://www.suckless.org/programs/dmenu.html">dmenu</a> or <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=56283">bashrun</a>, so I'm using both), a freedesktop-compliant autostarter and that's basically it.  Less is more!</p>
