<p>However, it seems like Debian is taking a route that will make it lose it's advantages over other distributions in the server market:<!--more--><br />

On april 8th <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2007/20070408">Debian released version 4.0</a>.  But very soon an <a href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5673962628.html">article</a> popped up and drew my attention.<br />

It complains about several problems such as multiple NIC's just not working.  After reading this, I skimmed over <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/i386/release-notes/ch-information.en.html">"potential problems" in their release notes</a>, and what do we see?  Many small issues that could have been fixed by just taking a bit longer, often accompanied by lines such as "Although<br />

<package x> has been tested extensively, you may experience minor problems...".  Problems varying from devices not being created to environment variables blindly being overwritten.  (Come on, how hard is it too prevent that?)<br />

So Debian is changing their release mechanism (or was this just a one-timer?  Even then it's bad practice), thereby loosing it's major benefits over other distributions on the servermarket.<br />

Personally I don't think issues like these will make server administrators switch to something else, but they'll sure have some work on their hands if they decide to upgrade ;-)</p>
