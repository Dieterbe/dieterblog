<p>For a while now I am typing using solely the Dvorak keyboard layout.  I roughly estimate it has been 4 or 5 months now - with the first month being a pain in the ass because i had to relearn typing pretty much from scratch - but now my typing speed is starting to exceed what it used to be in querty, and I still have much headroom to improve.</p>

<p>For those who have no clue what I'm talking about: think for 30 seconds which characters you type the most and which the least (eg: which characters occur the most/least in the language you type?).</p>

<p>Ok you got them?  Now look at your keyboard and spot where these characters are.  Now consider where your fingers are most of the time (if you've never learned to type: the 'base position' for your fingers is on the middle row).  Notice anything strange?<!--more--></p>

<p>Now how take a look at this picture:<br />

Definitely quite unconventional, but doesn't it make sense?</p>

<p>Dvoraks benefits are both technical (faster typing speed) and physical (less strain on your fingers, less chance for injuries such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">rsi</a>)<br />

If you would like more information, I highly recommend <a href="http://dvzine.org">dvzine.org</a>.  They have a <a href="http://dvzine.org/zine/01-toc.html">web comic</a> that tells you all you want to know and helps you start using Dvorak</p>

<p>Sure, learning a new keyboard layout is not easy.  The first weeks are a pain.  And it takes a few months to get back up to speed.  But I'm 23 years old and I hope I will be typing for about 50 more years.  Considering that I find it well worth switching!</p>
