<p>You probably know you can resize primary partitions by deleting them and recreating them, keeping the starting block the same but using a higher block as ending point.  You can then increase the filesystem.<br />
But what about logical partitions?  A while back I had to resize an ext3 logical partition which ended at the end of the last logical partition.  I learned some usefull stuff but I only made some quick scratch notes and I don't remember all details so:<br />
<strong>Do not expect a nice tutorial here, it's more of a commented dump of my scratch notes and some vague memories.<br />
The information in this post is not 100% accurate</strong><br />
I wondered if I could just drop and recreate the extended partition (and if needed, recreating all contained logical partitions, the last one being bigger of course) but nowhere I could find information about that.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>I did find various places where they said parted could "handle all partition and filesystem resizing at once".<br />
<a href="http://www.jumpingbean.co.za/blogs/mark/parted_resize_ext3_partition">this post</a> was quite useful, but he was more lucky then me I guess.<br />
In the parted documentation I couldn't find any restriction other then that xattrs don't work.<br />
But it does not support the dir_index and resize_inode features (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=406680">bug ticket</a>)<br />
You should be able to use tune2fs to remove these options, do the resize and then put them back.  But tune2fs can't put them back and I even had problems removing resize_inode (see below)<br />
Also, I falsely assumed parted would resize the extended partition when you tell it to resize the logical partition.</p>
<p>see here what i did, along with comments and remarks:<br />

# what features are enabled?<br />
linux-staging:~# tune2fs -l | grep -i feature<br />
Filesystem features:      resize_inode dir_index filetype sparse_super large_file [has_journal]</p>
<p># remove resize_inode feature<br />
linux-staging:~# tune2fs -O ^resize_inode /dev/hda9<br />
tune2fs 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)<br />
Invalid filesystem option set: ^resize_inode # HUH ?</p>
<p># okay then, lets try debugfs<br />

debugfs 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)<br />

<p># lets do an e2fsck.  It gave errors but maybe that's normal (?)<br />
# I wonder whether debugfs just unsets the option flags or actually updates the filesystem to not use these features at all (in the latter case, e2fsck should be clean)<br />

<p>After this experience I actually created a VM to do some testing and figured out this is the better way (no fsck errors, and goes much faster):</p>
<ul>
<li>use parted only to increase the extended partition</li>
<li>drop and recreate logical partition with fdisk</li>
<li>resize2fs the logical partition</li>
</ul>
