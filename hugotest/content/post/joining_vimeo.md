Working on <a href="/building_a_search_engine.html">scalable information retrieval systems at the university of Ghent</a> has been very fun: interesting and challenging work, smart team, and an environment that fosters growth and innovation.  I could definitely see myself continuing there...

<br/>

However, <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> got in touch and told me about their plans... specifically what's going into the <a href="https://vimeo.com/35514005">new version</a> and what other stuff they have on their roadmap.

I can honestly say vimeo is the most beautiful web property I've ever seen [*], not just that, they also provide a top product/service, and host a great community of passionate people who create some of the most beautiful online videos I've ever seen.  (examples: <a href="https://vimeo.com/37071868">Vietnam travel report</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/33993701">Sabian cymbals taking advertising to a whole new level in this video with my musician hero Mike Portnoy</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/23237102">a city time lapse video</a>)

<br/>

From what I can tell, they also do product management well:  they know what their territory is, and how to cultivate it through <a href="https://vimeo.com/16929813">stellar community management</a>.  They are <a href="https://vimeo.com/21585295">not a general purpose video site and hence do not compete directly with YouTube or Facebook</a>.

<p>And now, I have the opportunity to be a part of that.  After much pondering I decided to go for it.  Resigning at the university was hard but smooth, I felt I had to take this chance and they were very supportive.

<br/>I'll be working on the infrastructure/backend side of things, I'm actually working on transcoding infrastructure right now.  Working from my place in Ghent, a move to NYC at some point in the future might happen, but we'll see...

[*] When they told me the new version would be more appealing than the old, I couldn't believe that's possible.

but to my own surprise they succeeded.
