<p>The <a href="/i_just_became_a_system_and_network_architect">adventure at Netlog</a> didn't work out entirely, so <em>I'm looking for a new challenge!</em></p>
<p>My new ideal (slightly utopic) job would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual engineering while still being close to the technical side as well, most notably system engineering and development.</li>
<li>Innovative: go where no one has gone before.
<li>Integrated in the open-source world.  (Bonus points for companies where open source is key in their business model)</li>
<p><!-- Either nearby (East Flanders, preferably the Ghent area), or far enough/international to not have travelling/i move /... -->
</ul>
<p>To get a detailed overview of my interests and skills, I refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Linkedin profile: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dieterplaetinck">http://www.linkedin.com/in/dieterplaetinck</a></li>
<li>My Curriculum Vitae. <a href="/files/curriculumvitae-dieter-plaetinck-2008-11-24-EN.pdf">EN</a> / <a href="/files/curriculumvitae-dieter-plaetinck-2008-11-24-NL.pdf">NL</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><!-- Interested parties can get reference contact information at my previous employer on request. --></p>
