      We have pretty good storage of timeseries data, collection agents, and dashboards.  But the idea of giving timeseries a "name" or a

      "key" is profoundly limiting us.  Especially when they're not standardized and missing information.

      <br/>Metrics 2.0 aims for <b>self-describing</b>, <b>standardized</b> metrics using <b>orthogonal tags</b> for every dimension.

      "metrics" being the pieces of information that point to, and describe timeseries of data.

      </p>By adopting metrics 2.0 you can:

      <ul>

        <li>increase compatibility between tools</li>

        <li>get immediate understanding of metrics</li>

        <li>build graphs, plots, dashboards and alerting expressions with minimal hassle</li>

      </ul>
