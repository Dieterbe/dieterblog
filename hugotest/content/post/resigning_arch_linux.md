A few days ago, I <a href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-releng/2012-July/002628.html">resigned as Arch Linux developer</a>.

<br/>I'm sad to go, but I felt like my work on Arch became a drag, so it was time I officialized my decreased interest.

The Releng team we started more than 3 years ago is now dead, but other developers are showing interest in iso building and installer scripts, so as long as they don't burn out, you'll see new isos again.

More information in my resignation mail linked above.

Dieter
