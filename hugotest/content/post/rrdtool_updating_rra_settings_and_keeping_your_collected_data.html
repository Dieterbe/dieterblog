When you use <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">rrdtool</a>, it can happen that you first create your databases, then collect a whole bunch of data and decide later you want more accuracy/longer periods.<br />

<!--more-->

Especially when using <a href="community.zenoss.org">zenoss</a> (the monitoring solution I mostly work with at <a href="http://www.kangaroot.net/">Kangaroot</a>), which uses very conservative RRD settings by default (i.e. 5-minute intervals for only the first 50 hours).  Zenoss provides a way for you to change the way RRD's are created, but not to apply those settings to already existing RRD files, which I found out *after* I started monitoring everything ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdresize.en.html">rrdresize</a> can help: it (just) adds or removes locations for rows.<br />

In my case it was not good enough because zenoss uses a variety of resolutions (step sizes), and so if you add rows to all of them rrdtool - when graphing - will often pick a higher resolution RRA that just had rows added (and hence contain unknown values), even though you have the values, albeit at a lower resolution.</p>

<p>So you need a way to update all rows in the RRA's.<br />

I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/802902/export-import-rrdtool-database-with-differents-rra/1867163#1867163">found</a> a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pmptools/source/browse/trunk/rrd/rrdmove">perl tool</a> that does just that.  (I think, I didn't study all details).  So, you install that in your /home/zenoss for instance and then you run the following script, which creates new rrd files with the new settings and uses the perl script to copy all data into it.</p>

Oh and btw, <a href="http://www.famzah.net/rrdwizard/index.php">rrdwizard</a> is a cool webapp when you're feeling too lazy/have forgotten how to write rrdtool commands</p>
