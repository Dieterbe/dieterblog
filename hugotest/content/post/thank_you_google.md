<br/>But I just wanted to say: <b>thank you</b>.

<br/>You provide us some nice services. Google search, Gmail, analytics, google maps, ...

<br/>All of these products are/were game changers and made the life of people all over the world easier.

<br/>Many people take them for granted and don't realise what it takes to design, engineer and operate these applications.

<br/>That you provide them for free makes it even more amazing. And as far as advertisements are concerned; many business models rely on them and I don't see that changing any time soon.

<br/>I'll take a personalized ad over a generic ad any day.  The more you can optimize targetted ads on my screen, the more useful I'll find them.

<br/>Just don't overdo them, but you know that already.
