<p>The <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewforum.php?id=27">Community contributions</a> subforum of the Arch Linux forums is awesome.<br />

It is the birthplace of many applications, most of them not Arch Linux specific.<br />

File managers, media players, browsers, window managers, text editors, todo managers, and so on.  Many shell scripts, urxvt extensions and dwm patches aswell.<br />

Most of the apps are designed after suckless/KISS principles, but there are also some GUI programs.</p>
