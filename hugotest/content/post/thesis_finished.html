<p>Yesterday, after a night of searching and fixing spelling errors, things that could be better explained and other small details,<br />

I got my thesis printed and delivered the six books to my school.<br />

<!--more--><br />

I updated the <a href="/masterproef">masterproef</a> page where you can now download the full 79 page report.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.lievendekeyser.net/">Lieven</a> for staying up late proposing corrections for my thesis.  ( He knows all about how it is for a student who still has to do some work in those last few hours... hehe )<br />

Also thanks <a href="http://blog.sanderfiers.com/">Sander</a>! He woke up at 7 'o clock to burn my CD's (my cd-burner is broken) and driving me to <a href="http://www.guthorel.be/kopieservice.html"> Guthorel copy center</a> ( who offer a great service btw!  And they were pretty cheap: 54 euro's for printing and binding 6 reports)<br />

Also thanks to Stefan for burning me that extra 7th disk which - apparently - was needed instead of 6 :p</p>

<p>Of course I have more people to thank, but they are already mentioned in my report ;-)</p>

<p>Now let's hope I get some good results for all the hard work that went into this ;-)</p>
