<p>I had to fix a problem at <a href="http://www.plaetinck.be">my dad's company</a>...<br />

"The network was broken."</p>

<p>It was a NetBEUI network connecting some windows stations - it has been running for years - and now suddenly the nodes couldn't find eachother.<br />

One of the boxes (windows 2000 iirc) had 2 network cards, one for the network, the other not used for anything (not even connected).  Disabling the latter - not even touching the former - fixed half of the network.</p>

<p>There was another box that couldn't find any other node in the network.  This happened to be a box of which the ps/2 mouse broke.  It had a usb mouse connected but since it was windows 95 it was not supported.  I removed the usb mouse and attached another ps/2 mouse.  This fixed not only the mouse but also the box could suddenly find the other boxes again....</p>

<p>Windows really does suck.</p>

<p>And the worst part is: even though all is fine now, I have no clue for how long it will work, and what will be the cause the next time it will be broken?</p>
