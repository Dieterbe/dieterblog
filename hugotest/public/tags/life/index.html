I have a one-way ticket to NYC on Sept. 21st.  <a href="http://vimeo.com/about">Vimeo HQ</a> is in Manhattan, and practically the whole team works in the building so it makes sense for me to relocate and join them locally.

I'm looking forward to working with the colleagues face to face, but mainly I'm looking forward to the experience of living in such a different place, and exploring the US.

In fact, I already have some small trips planned (Hamptons NY, camping in Pennsylvania, skiing in New York this winter) with some friends <a href="/thailand_berlin_velocity_nyc_ghent_metal.html">I met last year in NY</a>.

We're also looking into possibly going to California or Mexico for the holidays.

<br/>

I've been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent</a> for about a year now and absolutely loved it.  I'll definitely miss Ghent, I think NYC might be a bit too hectic for my taste, but I just <i>have</i> to try this and see :)  There's so much to learn and explore.

I especially have high expectations of the music scene, which I'ld like to get involved in. (btw my <a href="http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/">ex-band</a> is recording an EP and looking for a new drummer)

As for things in Belgium: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151066748715279.458359.627030278&type=3&l=1fa8adec26">selling furniture</a>, moving out of my apartment next weekend, having a goodbye drink friday sept. 14th, flying a week later and returning in the summer 2013 for the <a href="http://www.gentsefeesten.be/">gentse feesten</a>.  Maybe I'll visit sooner, depending on how homesick I get :)

		<p>I've been meaning to write about a lot of stuff in separate posts, but they kept getting delayed, so I'll just briefly share everything in one post.

<h3>Thailand</h3>

In July I did a 3-week group journey through Thailand arranged by <a href="http://www.explorado.be">Explorado</a>, but organized by ("outsourced to") the 2 guides of <a href="http://www.rootsofasia.com/">roots of Asia</a>, who did <a href="http://www.rootsofasia.com/get-to-know-us/feedback.html">an amazing job</a>.

The whole concept was exploring "the real Thailand" by means of <i>Eco-tourism</i>.  We've been in Bangkok (twice), Chiang Mai city, a mountain village in the province of Chiang Mai, through the jungle, at a fisherman village in Phuket and at the tropical island of Koh Pha ngan.

The latter was at the end of the trip and was timed perfectly to get some deserved rest in a more touristy (although not too busy) area, but the majority of the trip was spent far away from the typical touristy areas so we could be submerged in honest, authentic Thai culture and visit authentic locations, often we were at locations where seeing a group of white folks is not common.

We've been at unique authentic temples, stayed with various locals and hill tribes, shared meals with them, took the same transport they did (at one point an entire village collected their bikes so we could borrow them to do a bike trip through rice fields and some of the most beautiful lakes I've ever seen).  We've had plenty of beautiful moments during those 3 weeks.  Like visiting the home of one of the local Thai who built his entire house out of clay, by himself and some friends, or visiting the ancient temple where our guide got married, in a forest in the hills, it was the most beautiful temple of the entire trip, but no other tourists go there because it's not really known (and should probably be kept that way).  Or going to a bar in Chiang Mai city (one evening on my own, the next I brought a fellow traveler) to have some good times with some locals.

The Eco-conscious part of the travel means:

<ul>

<li>green travel (minimize impact on the environment, "leave no trace").  Other than taking the plane over there and back we did a pretty good job, we've used public buses, night trains, biodegradable soap, etc</li>

<li>local foods (no import, minimal packaging, wrap in banana leaves, etc)</li>

<li>supporting Eco-conscious projects (like <a href="http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/">elephant nature park</a>, which is an entire volunteer-based reserve to give mistreated elephants (which has been a big problem in Thailand) a better life, where we washed and fed elephants)</li>

</ul>

This has been a great experience, and although I found the culture in the South disgustingly based on profiting from tourists, and the cities are too polluted and dirty, I've seen cultures so respectful of nature and each other, living by values I've been trying to apply at home - but being frowned upon in our western society because we're so brainwashed by consumerism, which was beautiful and heartwarming.

<h3>Berlin</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/berlin_reichstag.jpg" alt="Berlin Reichstag building" height="150px"/>

I've been in Berlin for the first <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu/">Velocity conference in the EU</a>, which was quite good.  The best part was probably the "Velocity Birds of feather" (whatever that means) unconference the day before at <a href="http://betahaus.de">betahaus</a>, which was great for meeting some folks such as the <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a> guys (which BTW, is the site we host our music on), although lots more interesting folks attended the conference itself (and it was packed).

Berlin itself was nice too.  Lots of history (Berlin wall, world war(s)), lots of impressive architecture (old and new), very cheap (albeit mediocre in quality) food, lots of Italian food, a bit cold though.



<h3 style="clear: left;">New York city</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/brooklyn_bridge.jpg" alt="Brooklyn bridge" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/manhattan_harbor.jpg" alt="Manhattan harbor" height="150px"/>

I'm still recovering from the awesome time I just had in NYC. I've been way more busy over there than I anticipated. I should have stayed 2 or 3 weeks instead of 1 :).  I've met various locals (one of whom who'd love to become a city guide as 2nd job because she just loves showing people around, so that just turned out great!). I didn't go for the typical touristy things (I skipped things like the WTC memorial, empire state building, statue of liberty, to the extent you can skip them, as they are very visible from pretty much all over the place).

Instead, I wanted to get a feel of the real city and the people inhabiting it.  I've seen parts of Queens, central and North-West Brooklyn, lots of areas (but not enough) in Manhattan and even Staten Island, been to a rock concert, comedy, improv and cabaret shows, the movies, more bars than I can count and mostly ate out with company (just as real new yorkers do, of course, though for breakfast that feels a bit weird).  I even went shopping (not mall-shopping, but groceries in the supermarket, the Williamsburg Foodtown - that's what it's called - clerk advised me to enjoy every last second in the US, phrased in a way as if any other place in the world sucks in comparison, which is ridiculous, but turns out I followed his advice anyway) because I stayed at an apartment in Williamsburg, I also had 2 roommates, with whom I ironically couldn't spend as much time as I wanted to as I was so busy meeting up with all those other people, I also visited the Etsy and Vimeo offices (both are awesome) and met up with Dave Reisner (who is one of our latest Arch Linux devs, and who lives in NJ, but don't tell anyone) and who forgot to show me around in the Google office ;-)  And I realize some of the past sentences are a bit long and busy but that's one of the things I learned at New York I guess.  For one week, I almost lived like a real New Yorker, and it was interesting (but exhausting).



<h3 style="clear: left;">Move to Ghent</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/ghent_bridge.jpg" alt="Ghent, bridge of Sint-Michiels" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/ghent_coupure.jpg" alt="Ghent, coupure" height="150px"/>

Enough about the trips.  Back to daily life.  I moved to the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent</a>.  Riding by bike to work every day along the scenic <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupure_%28Gent%29">Coupure</a> is fun.

I am quite proud to say nearly all of my stuff in this apartment is second hand and I've been lucky to receive some free stuff as well (thanks Bram!).  Not (only) because I'm <span style="text-decoration:line-through">cheap</span> money conscious but I like to give things a second life instead of buying something new, lowering the impact on the environment. Even if it doesn't look too well, as long as it's functional.  And this is exactly one of those values I mentioned above which is often not understood in our Western society but I was pleased to find out this philosophy is the standard in large parts of Thai culture.



<h3 style="clear: left;">Death metal</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/li_promoshoot.jpg" alt="Promo shoot" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/li_frontline.jpg" alt="Live @ Frontline, Ghent" height="150px"/>

We've done 3 gigs (which had great reception, luckily) and we've got planned a few already for 2012, one of which will be at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/From-Rock-Till-Core/141364465969247">From Rock Till Core festival</a> in Merelbeke.

We also did a semi-professional <a href="http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/album_promoshoot_summer_2011">photo-shoot</a>, and I made a <a href="http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/">website</a> (you can tell I'm not a designer).

<br style="clear: left;" />

<br/>

That wraps up 2011 for me. Good times.. Happy new year everybody!

		For the last few months, I've started to actively use hitchhiking as a means to

travel between home and work.

What started as a "I'm not sure about this, it seems a bit awkward, but I do

want to know how it goes and feels, so I'll try it out once" ended up being "this is

great, I'm doing it every day and loving it".

Here's why you should try it and why it may make your life more awesome.

<!--more-->

<h3>Why do I do it?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Meet new interesting people.  I meet a lot of different people with all kinds of

  backgrounds.  Male, female.  Young, old.  Native Belgians, immigrants,

students, anything from "lower class" people, to people with regular jobs to even some people with very exciting

lives and/or high profile jobs.</li>

<li>It's better for the planet.</li>

<li>Save time and/or money.  For me, traveling to/from work by hitchhiking is

  quicker than going by public transport (bus).  Bonus points because my route

involves a pleasant bike ride to the highway entry where I start my little

adventure.</li>

<li>No concerns about parking and/or paying for gas.  My job is near the

  highway exit so usually I get dropped off literally in front of the building.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Why do people take you with them?</h3>

From what I can tell:

<ul>

<li>They like to do something nice, it makes them feel like a better person

  (rightly so).</li>

<li>They are bored in the car and would like some companionship.</li>

<li>Out of compassion.  "poor guy must be standing here for a long time",

  which is rarely true, and I think compassion is not needed, but hey.

  Some drivers told me "I did the same when I was a student so I know it feels

  like".  Most folks are surprised though when I tell them I do it because I

like to.</li>

<li>Concern that something bad will happen to you. Which I also think is not

  really needed, but hey.</li>

<li>curiosity, they want to hear your story.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Why you should try it</h3>

What I learned is, not only can hitchhiking bring you to work faster than by

public transport and/or in a less polluting manner, it can be a fun experience for both you and person

picking you up.  Indeed, some people that pick me up never picked anybody up before

and tell me at the end they were happy they did it, and you can tell their day is made.

Also, avoiding routine makes your days more memorable and interesting.

Btw, I recently stumbled on <a

href="http://lifehacker.com/5800954/escape-the-rut-of-your-daily-routine-by-trying-something-new-for-30-days">this

presentation</a>, which tells you how you can make your daily life more

interesting and memorable by trying out new things, the video fits this post

well :)

</p>



<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>

<li>Sometimes you can have bad luck (no pick up, traffic jam, ...).  It helps if

  you have flexible working hours like me.</li>

<li>Have some good card boards with your destination clearly written.  If you live in a small

  village like me, write down the name of a bigger city which is in the same

direction.</li>

<li>Find a spot where drivers have time to see you, have some time to read your

  cardboard and to make up their mind about whether or not to pick you up and then have enough room

to legally put their car to allow you to get in.  All this without endangering

other people in traffic.  When going to work I can stand just at the entry to the highway,

where not that many cars pass, but I have an almost guaranteed pickup within 5

minutes because drivers have time to react.  Whereas when going from work back home, I have no choice but to stand

at a very busy section where drivers have little time to react (avg pickup time there

is 10 minutes or a bit more).</li>

<li>look decently dressed. People tell me they felt okay picking me up

  because I look civilized.</li>

<li>If you're a girl, it could be trickier because you could feel uncomfortable

  with some people who pick you up.  That said, I think there are many more people with good

intentions then bad, and you can always say "no thanks" and wait for the next

ride.</li>

</ul>

Note: this article is not accurate anymore.  I have since moved to Ghent, where

I go to work by bike, but that's material for a future post.

<p>Since the audience of this blog is largely technical, I don't post much about other topics, but I feel it's time for a short summary about one of my "real life projects".

<br/>In the spring of 2009 I joined a progressive death metal band.  I've been drumming since I was 17, but during the last 2 years I've been practising and rehearsing like never before.[1]

<br/>When you hear yourself on tape for the first time, it's a bit of disillusionment as you suddenly hear every imperfection, many of which you didn't realise you had (or didn't think were very noticeable).

<br/>So 2 years of practicing, rehearsing, test recordings, real recordings, mixing sessions (where you really grow a good ear towards imperfections) later we are now getting to the point where we can nail our stuff and are looking very forward to our first gig, which will be June 3rd in <a href="http://www.jhsjatoo.org/">jh sjatoo</a> in Kalken.

We've written about 7 songs, of which at this point we play 5. I wish we had proper recordings of all of them, but "Total Annihilation" captures several aspects of our style:

<object height="225" width="65%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2762471"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="225" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2762471" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="65%"></embed> </object>

<br/>In early 2010 I treated myself (found a nice 2nd hand deal) to a new pdp birch kit with Zildjian Z custom cymbals (that was actually at the time I was in the <a href="/not_working_for_facebook.html">interview process for a Palo-Alto position at Facebook</a> so I might have needed to sell it again soon after, but that didn't happen).

		Today at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/">Fosdem 2011</a> I did my talk <a href="http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall">Can we build a simple, cross-distribution installation framework?</a>

Basically, using the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> Installation Framework as a starting point, along with the notion that most of the code is actually not Arch-specific I adressed other distros to check

if there was any interest in sharing workload on the distribution-agnostic aspects of the framework. If other distros with a similar philosophy of little-abstractions/KISS would join, we would all reap the benefits of a simple, yet quite featureful installer.

There was some interest, so we'll see what happens.

		On February 4, I'll be in Amsterdam at <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/dir2011/cfp.html">DIR 2011</a>, the 11th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop.

After that, I'm going to the devopsdinner and Fosdem beer event in Brussels.

On february 5/6 of course, Fosdem itself.  Looking forward to the systemd talk.

On sunday I'll do a talk about <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall">simple shell based Gnu/Linux installers</a>,

like mentioned earlier I hope devs from other "lightweight"/kiss-style distro's will be present (Gentoo and other *too's, Crux, *ppix, ... You know who you are)

It would be interesting to share some common codebase for distribution independent topics (like filesystems), or at least discuss how feasible it would be.

		<p>I started working at <a href="http://www.ibcn.intec.ugent.be/">IBCN</a>, the research group of the university of Ghent.

I was looking to get back to the challenging world of high-performance and large-scale (web) applications, but I also wanted something more conceptual and researchy, rather then the highly hands-on dev- and ops work I've been doing for a few years now.

<br/>The <a href="https://projects.ibbt.be/bom-vl/">Bom-vl</a> project is pretty broad: it aims to make the Flemish cultural heritage media more useable by properly digitizing, archiving and making public the (currently mostly analog) archives from providers such as TV stations.</p>

<img src="/files/blog/ibbt/ilabt2.jpg">

<p>Currently, I believe there's some >100TB of media in our cluster (mostly from VRT, afaik), along with associated textual descriptions/metadata, with more to follow.  The application is currently for a selected audience but the goal is to make it public in the near future.

I'm part of the search engine team, we aim to provide users with the most relevant hits for their queries, by using existing technology (think Lucene, hadoop, etc) or devising our own where needed.

As I'm charged with a similarity search problem ("other videos which might also interest you"), I'm studying information retrieval topics such as index and algorithm design and various vector models. Starting next week, I'll probably start implementing and testing some approaches.</p>

		<p>I'm back from Canada/Archcon, and it was great. I've been in Toronto for 11 days, and visited Montreal for 3 days.</p>

<h3>Archcon</h3>

<p>Archcon was small (20-ish people).  (That's what you get for doing it in Canada ;), but very nice.<br />

Interesting talks, informal, good vibe, decent logistics and catering.<br />

This year it happened because Dusty and Ricardo actually just wanted to have a conference without worrying too much about the attendance,<br />

next year we should do it again because Arch (conferences) rock(s), and because we need more visitors.  More central locations such as Seattle and Europe have been suggested.<br />

Either way, next year both Judd (founder) and Aaron (current overlord) should be there. (this year they both had lame excuses like family reunions and "almost getting married".  Congrats btw, Aaron!)</p>

<p>It was an absolute pleasure to meet some more of my fellow devs, and users.<br />

Here is a pic from the group (unfortunately, a few are missing)<!--more--><br />

<img src="/files/group.jpg"/><br />

People in bold are Arch (ex-) devs</p>

<ol>

<li>Richard (sokuban) from Toronto (linguistics student)</li>

<li>Chris (Gallow) from Toronto</li>

<li>Alex (alexmat) from Tokyo, Japan (very into NILFS, submitted already some patches)</li>

<li>Sander (GogglesGuy) (Dutch guy living in the states now)</li>

<li>Eric from Seattle, WA</li>

<li>Gregory (gelendir) from Quebec city, Canada (aka dude wearing the kilt and fivefingers and funny accent)</li>

<li><b>Kevin (kpiche)</b> from Ottawa (does perl stuff iirc)</li>

<li><b>Loui (louipc)</b> from Toronto, Canada (AUR guy, git lover.  metalfan.  Shook John Petrucci's hand)</li>

<li>Tim from Annapolis (uses Arch for servers at work with some fancy mass-install scripts)</li>

<li>Dustin (daking) from Stanford, CA (runs most of Stanford university on Arch)</li>

<li><b>me</b> from Belgium (arch-releng/aif, uzbl guy) </li>

<li>David (davekong) from New York City</li>

<li><b>Dan (toofishes)</b> from Chicago (Pacman dev)</li>

<li><b>Dusty</b> from Shaunavon SK (shwag, archcon organizer)</li>

<li>Ricardo (ralvez) from  Toronto (archcon organizer)</li>

<li><b>Jason (Xentac)</b> from Victoria, BC (entrepeneur, used to use Arch for the business)</li>

</ol>

<p>See <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=101692">Archcon thread</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I barely slept the night before my AIF talk, so I feel that one didn't go to well.  Although people told me it was OK.<br />

The Uzbl talk was pretty much what I imagined it to be: like the fosdem talk, but a bit more in depth here and there.<br />

My pc was behaving weirdly, but luckily I could use Dan's.</p>

<p>We've been lucky that Walter and Isaac had proper, respectively videotaping and photocamera equipment.  So there are plenty of pics, and nearly all talks got videotaped.<br />

(I think the "hacking pacman" one was the only one not being videotaped, because 2 other talks were going on at the same time.  Too bad, it was a very interesting talk)</p>

<h3>Other days</h3>

<p>Some thoughts and notes of what I did and saw around Toronto/Montreal..</p>

<ul>

<li>Cities with streets and subways in a grid layout are awesome.  Soo much easier to navigate.</li>

<li>Red lights with countdown timers (in seconds) are awesome.  Although I'm told some places in Europe have them too.</li>

<li>Toronto was awesome: huge city, many friendly people, low crime rate, many different cultures, very short history.  High park was very nice. <img src="/files/blog/toronto.ca/high_park_004_500.jpg"/></li>

<li>Montreal was like a European city: more history, old buildings, more crime, but of course a grid layout.  Some nice views though (ie. from Mont Royal).</li>

<li>The youth hostels I went too were great: never got to meet so many interesting people in such a short timespan.</li>

<li>CN tower: I procrastinated visiting until the last day, and when I finally wanted to go in the wheather was perfect, but there was a 2 hour queue, so I skipped it. Anyway there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">plenty of pictures online</a>.</li>

<li>Niagara falls were beautiful.  Maid of the myst tour was worth it.  I made pictures but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niagara_falls_panorama.jpg">those online</a> are better.</li>

<li>I met Kan Johar (founder of <a href="http://plurk.com">plurk.com</a>, amongst others), good times.</li>

<li>Dusty introduced me to poutine.  I found it disgusting.  I guess you need to be a Canadian before you can like it.<br> <img src="/files/poutine.jpg"/></li>

<li>Dusty and I have been to the <a href="http://linuxcaffe.ca/">Linux Caffe.</a>  The owner is a great guy, he's considering switching to Arch, and he wrote his whole point of sales, accounting and bookkeeping software using shell scripts, perltk and stuff.  He's into suckless.org stuff.   His version 2.0 will probably be based on Xmonad.<br />

		<p>As mentioned <a href="/uzbl_monitoring_aif_talks">earlier</a>, I'll be at <a href="http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/">Archcon in Toronto</a> in a few weeks.<br />

It's a very small conference, and the first of its kind.  At the <a href="/froscon_2009_afterthoughts">last FrOSCon</a> we have been playing with the idea to hold an informal Arch conference in Europe, but those were just ideas.  Dusty and Ricardo beat us with an actual implementation.<br />

This is great, and one of the milestones in Arch Linux history.  Which is why I want to be there and help making it better.<!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/?p=116">Archcon schedule</a>.  I'll be talking about AIF and uzbl.</p>

<p>My schedule:</p>

<ul>

<li>wed. July 14: departure</li>

<li>July 14 - 21: hanging around in downtown Toronto. Not sure yet where I'll stay. probably some hostel.</li>

<li>July 21 - 28: bed and breakfast pretty close to the conference location, outside the city center</li>

<li>July 22 - 23 are the conference talks days, July 24-25 are the conference tourist days, where we'll do some touristy stuff with the conference participants</li>

<li>wed. July 28: flying back</li>

</ul>

<p>There are <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archcon_extra_activities">many things to do</a> in and around Toronto. We still need to make the planning, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls">Niagara Falls</a> are definitely on the list.</p>

<p>Finally, big thanks to <a href="http://www.elys.com/home/">Elysium Digital</a>, a technology oriented consulting company for legal matters. Apparently they use Arch Linux for many things: on the desktop, in the server room, and in the forensic lab.   They emailed me to propose sponsoring my plane tickets, and they did.</p>

		<p>In november last year, I was contacted by Facebook HR.<br />

They found my background interesting and thought I might be a good<br />

fit for an "application operations engineer" position in Palo Alto, California. (it is<br />

basically the link between their infrastructure engineering and operations/support<br />

teams).<!--more--><br />

I did a few technical interviews over phone with other app ops and engineers<br />

from CA (about the Linux kernel, lowlevel userspace, mysql, memcached, networking, programming,<br />

scalability, etc) and solved one of their optimisation puzzles.<br />

( I picked <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=2">usr bin crash</a>.  Actually I wanted to do something with <a

href="http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/">thrift</a> but <a

href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-thrift-user/200911.mbox/%3C20091122202901.1f425b7f@plaetinck.be%3E">I

couldn't get it to compile</a>).

<br/>The technical interviews went well but then I had<br />

another interview which was about handling support.  As I have no experience<br />

in setting up support frameworks and procedures to hand off to separate<br />

support teams, I was/am not good enough for this position.</p>

<p>Then they suggested a role as site reliability engineer for the office in Dublin, which is more about<br />

troubleshooting, monitoring and systems management/automation.<br />

So I did some more interviews with SRE's and engineers from the London office and<br />

from Palo Alto.  Similar subjects as before, but with more of an operations/support touch to it.<br />

These also went well, except the last one, which was more about things less related to<br />

high-performance/scalability such as nfs, pam and ldap.<br />

I think I missed too many questions on the last interview.  I could come up<br />

with some excuses such as me being tired (it was the evening before our <a

href="http://www.kangaroot-showcase.be/">Kangaroot showcase</a> event, and<br />

the call being late - Facebook HR messed up a timezone conversion) but fact<br />

of the matter is: I have little experience with such "office ;-)" stuff.</p>

<p>So after 8 interviews over phone (each one about 40-60 minutes), spanning<br />

about 2 months, they let me know they would not go forward with me.<br />

That was late december, I asked for some feedback but haven't heard from<br />

them since.</p>

<p>Bottomline: it sounded quite nice but I'm pretty <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html">happy</a> with my current life in Belgium.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I'm back from the 3-day <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009">maemo summit</a> in Amsterdam.  It was very nice.  Very well organized, and Nokia definitely invested enough in catering, fancy-suited people and such to please all 400 of us.  I met several interesting people, both from the community, as well as Nokia guys.<br />

The talks were diverse, but interesting (duh?).  I will especially remember the kickoff with its fancy visual effects and loud music that set the mood straight for the entire weekend.<br />

The best moment was, of course, when it was announced that <strong>every summit participant would receive a n900.  Uncontrolled hapiness all around. </strong><br />

<!--more--><br />

I had been hoping to buy/preorder the device at the event, with maybe a nice reduction.  But I didn't dare to hope on getting a device in my hands just like that.</p>

<p>So how does this work?<br />

Basically, all summit attendees were offered the following deal (I don't think anyone passed it).  I paraphrase:</p>

<p><cite>User gets to use n900 preproduction model until end of April 2010 or earlier if Nokia wants so.<br />

User provides feedback to Nokia in any form, which Nokia gets ownership of.<br />

User may not copy/reverse engineer/decompile device/material/software.  But other then that he can fully use it, hack (on) it and share information about it.<br />

No warranty or any form of compensation if the device blows up your house, breaks your arm, or submits your personal data to pastebin.com<br />

</cite></p>

<p>Definitely fair enough I would say.  I'll surely stick to my end of the deal and provide them a good dose of feedback.</p>

<p>My first experiences?  Here are the main things:</p>

<ul>

<li>I think the hardware is definitive, the software probably isn't.</li>

<li>Meets all expectations:

<ul>

<li>Complete debian-based mini-pc which fits in pocket easily.  A screen (800x480) which shows normal webpages just fine, no need for smaller pages.  Typing on keyboard is a lot slower then on a netbook.  For me the device could have been bigger so I could do 10-finger typing (I would call using a headset anyway), but I'm sure many people like the small formfactor</li>

<li>A userland we are used to: glibc, sysvinit, dbus, gstreamer, bluez, gtk, HAL, apt, and so on</li>

<li>Very nice and easy UI, high performance multitasking, 3D, many nice details seem to be implemented just when you need them, ...</li>

<li>Not just a "OS + apps" but everything can be (and usually is) integrated: i.e. contact book with the various means to reach a contact (jabber/sms/skype/cellular call/..).  when you call someone it will choose skype or cellular, whichever is best. (this probably expands to SIP and whichever means more applications will bring).  Contacts with birthdays show up in the calendar, etc.</li>

<li>Quite smooth UI. Sometimes a bit of stutter in multitask view when closing or switching apps (but hey, nothing my real PC doesn't do)</li>

<li>Many features for such a small form factor.  The hardware feels "done"</li>

<li>Battery lasts long enough.   About 30 hours for light to medium use on a new device</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Slight nuisances, mostly with the software:

<ul>

<li>The microB browser needs some polishing.  It hangs when the wifi goes away</li>

<li>Some lack of consistency in UI across maemo interface and various apps (scrolling behaviour is sometimes different, "just start typing to initiate search" doesn't apply everywhere) </li>

<li>Hard to open back cover and to remove battery </li>

<li>Shell (ash) history does not (always?) get saved</li>

<li>No tools such as less, sed, curl, awk, ... by default.  No packages for them yet</li>

<li>Maps application feels incomplete.  It's not a navigation system like Tomtom (and a Nokia guy told me they aren't aiming for that)</li>

<li>It continously tries looking for network when it can't find any, even though I keep saying no</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p>I'm keeping a detailed list of all issues I encounter, which I'll report on the bugtracker.<br />

Until now all issues I found are small, and most are fixable in a short timespan so I think the "real" devices will be there soon.<br />

I'm definitely looking forward playing more with it and hacking it.<br />

And most of all, I think I will actually begin trusting this device enough to maintain my contacts, calendar, .. and to actually use the features it brings (instead of for example ssh'ing to home and chatting from there)</p>

<p>Great work Nokia, you guys rock.</p>

<p>** update: 13-10-2009: updated the battery uptime number to 30 hours.  I measured it for real this time.</p>

		<p>I have been looking for the <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=580045">"perfect mobile companion device"</a> already for a while.  Basically I want a "pocket PC that can do as much as possible over which i have as much control as possible so I can do things my way, but still fits in a pocket and which can do gsm and such"<br />

So, something like a netbook, but really portable, and that can also do telephony stuff.<br />

Nokia's recently announced <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">n900</a> seems to be very close to what I'm looking for.<br />

It could have been a tad bigger (to make typing easier) but other then that it looks perfect: powerful, high resolution display, Linux with a "usual" userspace (unlike Android) to give me all freedom I'm looking for, keyboard, plenty of space and many goodies such as wifi, a-gps, fm receiver/transmitter, IR, bluetooth, digital camera, tv-out and so on.</p>

<p>This device has ignited my interest in Maemo and all things related so I'll be in Amsterdam on October 9-10-11, at the <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009">Maemo summit 2009</a>.  I was lucky enough to score a place in the <a href="http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/hotel-1556-ibis-amsterdam-centre/index.shtml">ibis hotel Amsterdam</a>, as Nokia has reserved more rooms then they could fill with invited speakers and own personnel ;-)<br />

I'm hoping it will be possible to buy a device at the conference.  The timing would be perfect.  Nokia seems to be a really cool company and so far, they haven't disappointed yet...</p>

<p>Somewhat related: a <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Mer">Mer (maemo alternative)</a> <a href="http://gitorious.org/~lbt">developer</a> told me he was very interested in making <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">uzbl</a> available on Mer, so he did just that. I'm curious myself how usable uzbl will be on the n900. Only one way to find out :)</p>

<p><a href="http://froscon.org/">Froscon</a> was great.</p>

<ul>

<li>It was smaller then I thought, I especially assumed more activity in the devrooms (I'm too used to <a href="http://fosdem.org/">fosdem</a> which is much bigger), but hey nice conference anyway.</li>

<li>It was great to meet (some of) my Arch Linux colleagues.  Mostly the guys from Germany showed up, and Roman who is from Ukraine.</li>

<li>We all got an Arch t-shirt/polo of which we could pick the color ourselves.  Woohoo.  Thanks donators.</li>

<li>A few people also told me they had tried / were using <a href="http://www.uzbl.org">uzbl</a> (my browser project) so that was really cool.</li>

<li>I had an interesting chat with <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/ls_juenger/people/lange/">Thomas Lange</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> (a tool to automatically mass-install systems, mostly Debian).  I've used it in the past, liked it and was somewhat inspired by it when building <a href="/AIF_the_brand_new_Arch_Linux_Installation_Framework">AIF</a>. (but some design goals are different).</li>

</ul>

<p>

Here is a picture of my "Arch releng partner" Gerhard (right) and I (left).  We've done a lot of work together and it was great to talk face to face for once.  Here we're showing (proudly) an Arch Linux Froscon disc (which is a slightly modified version of the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/news/459/">2009.08 core images</a>):</p>

		<p>So, the Arch Linux <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=77680">2009.08 release</a> is now behind us, nicely on schedule.<br />

I hope people will like <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/aif/">AIF</a> because it was a lot of work and we didn't receive much feedback.  I personally like it to apply my <a href="/rethinking_the_backup_paradigm_a_higher-level_approach">fancy backup restoration</a> approach.<br />

But I'm sure if more people would look at the code we would find quite some design and implementation things that could be improved.  (With <a href="/uzbl_a_browser_that_adheres_to_the_unix_philosophy">uzbl</a> I was amazed how much difference it can make if many people all have ideas and opinions about every little detail)</p>

<p>Later this week I'm off to the <a href="http://www.countingcows.be/home.php">Counting Cows festival</a> in France, and the week after that (august 22-23) I'm going to <a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon</a> in Germany where I will meet some of my Arch Linux colleagues in real life, which I'm really looking forward to.</p>

<p>If anyone wants a ride to froscon let me know.  But note I'll try to maximize my time there (leave saturday early and come back late on sunday.  I even took a day off on monday so I might stay a day longer if I find more interested people to hang out there)</p>

		<p>When you're stuck on a problem, or not even stuck but you just want to boost your creative/out-of-the-box thinking...<br />

Take a shower.  When I'm thinking about a problem and I take a shower, the ideas and thoughts just start popping up, one after each other, or sometimes even two at the same time.  It's amazing.  And it works every time.<!--more--></p>

<p>Sometimes the amount of thoughts and ideas is so much that I need a piece of paper to write everything down immediately when I come out, otherwise I'll forget stuff before I leave the bathrooom.</p>

<p>If you work from home, it can be beneficial to not shower in the morning (because then the mind is fresh enough to be creative), but rather doing it somewhere before noon or in the afternoon. (of course this depends on what you're working on)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I've been reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> lately and it's absolutely a great and inspiring book.<br />

Having made my home office space into a real <i>Zen</i> I want to start implementing GTD in my digital life but it seems very hard to find a good GTD tool that fully implements GTD. (even though there are a lot of tools out there)</p>

<p>The most interesting ones (each for different reasons) I've looked at so far are <a href="http://www.thinkingrock.com.au/index.php">Thinkingrock</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">tracks</a> and <a href="https://gna.org/projects/yagtd/">yagtd</a> (the latter requiring most work before it does everything I need, but it's also the most easy to dive into the code base). I'm keeping my eyes open because there are certainly more things to discover.</p>

<p>Even though there are probably no applications out there that can do everything I want, I just wanted to share my feature-wishlist.  These are the requirements I find that a really good tool should comply with:<br />

<!--more--><br />

In order of importance (sort of):</p>

<ul>

<li><i>I want to have control over both my data and application.</i><br />

 At least half of the GTD apps out there are websites ran by an external party.  I want to run the application myself, I must have access to the source code, and I want to have my data myself.</li>

<li><i>Rapid idea collection and processing.</i><br />

  David Allen mentions the importance of this several times.  Sometimes you are doing something but come up with something else which you want to write down to continue your other stuff as quickly as you can.  Later on - in 'processing mode' - these notes must be handled one by one, and it must be easy to choose whether you want to create a new task from this note, throw it away, file/further edit as a note for something else and so on.  For some reason many GTD applications skip these very important collection and processing steps and assume their users will enter actions right away.  For now I've only seen Thingkingrock handling this nicely (or at all).  A workaround could be to use a notes-taking application such as tomboy as collection bucket, and process that every once in a while but then you'll need to copy-paste stuff from one application into another etc.  Doable but cumbersome and avoidable.</li>

<li><i>Context / project editors</i><br />

Context and projects are entities on their own. I don't want any of them disappearing/non-existing just because there are no actions that 'link to them' anymore/yet.  (which seems to be the case with yagtd).  Tracks handles this really nicely.</li>

<li><i>Advanced reference system.</i><br />

Notes/documentation (with documentation I don't mean physical files such as *.pdf or *.odt but just textual data) must be able to get filed and easily be retrieved by itself or by associated item.  A note should be able to be linked to an action or project but must also be able to stand on it's own through it's title and/or a tagging system.  Some notes can even be related to multiple projects/actions (from different projects).  In many cases I find it useful to link a project to one or more notes who are already general reference material or linked to something else.  So this goes <i>way</i> beyond the simple 'description' fields that most tools offer.  Support for holding not only text, but also hyperlinks, images, movie clips, would be a plus. (not the most important though)</li>

<li><i>File format</i><br />

An easily accessible file format is a plus for a variety of reasons.  Plaintext is the winner here (yagtd).  Tracks does not seem to support a plaintext backend but it does support an api/rss/.. and an export feature so that counts too.  ThinkingRock uses xml. (mixed feelings about that)

</li>

<li><i>action/project dependencies</i><br />

Some actions or projects can't be done at all as long as another project or action is not finished.  If you can specify this in your program, than the program can put the action/project in the 'waitingfor' section and move it  to 'next actions' when the dependencies are fulfilled. (after asking confirmation maybe)</li>

<li><i>Calendar integration</i><br />

A full featured calender does not belong in a GTD tool, ( because on a calender you also want to put non-actionable stuff like certain events, birthdays,...) but there does need to be support for exporting everything with a date on it (actions with due dates or that can only happen on specific moments each week/day/...) to a calendar.  Ical is probably the most common for this, but with an rss feed or rest api I can help myself too. (by converting it into ical or whatever)</li>

<li><i>project planning on the beforehand</i><br />

When planning a project you already know more action steps then just the next one for a project.  If you can specify these in a good way (e.g. not by abusing the project description field) the program can open the next action when you complete the current one.</li>

<li><i>Reminders</i><br />

I want to be informed automatically of stuff that *needs* to happen.  Gtk or libnotify popups are great, e-mail will do too.  Being able to respond to the notification to say 'inform me again at $foo' or 'i just did this, close the action!' are a plus.

</li>

<li><i>History</i><br />

When did I do this? What happened to item X at this date?  Questions that sometimes need an answer and it's frustrating if you don't have them.</li>

<li><i>GTD on the road</i><br />

I can use a paper notebook for collecting ideas and for quickly writing some reminders down before closing the laptop but having access to my GTD data on my phone would be really nice. (preferably by syncing the phone with my laptop to be not dependent on a network at all times) (I will be having an iphone soon)

</li>

<li><i>Integration with email</i><br />

How great would be to specify in your GTD tool 'this action is waiting for John Doe' and later, when you receive a mail from John Doe you can say 'this closes this action' ?  Or for each mail in your inbox you have some options to import the contents into your collection bucket, into a new task or into the filing system?  Practically how this could work is through an api like what tracks offers, or by dbus for desktop programs.

</li>

</ul>

<h3>About the book</h3>

<p>GTD has received a lot of hype, which made me sceptical at first but while reading the book it became clear the praise is deserved.<br />

Right from the beginning you start learning many things, and throughout the book the 'eureka' moments keep coming.  Even I who have been thinking quite a lot on how to organize my todo's, ideas and reference material am surprised by how much can be improved.  There are some points that are not new and are also mentioned in other time management books (such as 'getting a clear head') but the great part is that GTD is not only about action management, but also about project planning, personal organisation, how to manage those ideas/questions/reminders that you come up with randomly, office organisation and so on. I was afraid that some things I do/need would not be handled in the book but it's definitely not the case.  And everything is handled both in theory and in practice with a lot of thoughts, ideas and practical recommendations.  David's advice after more then 20 years of productivity consulting/training/research is something that no-one should miss.<br />

From a writers perspective: I find it also amazing how stuff that is so hard to explain is so well organized and explained in a easy to understand phrasing throughout the entire book.  Not that I know much about this field but it's clear that this part of the book also has gotten a lot of work.  In a few rare cases I found that some recommendations were not backed up enough but those were just details.</p>

<p>While reading the book (I haven't finished it yet btw) I spent several days cleaning up my room.  I started using a filing cabinet for my reference material (placed very accessibly!), organized supplies and equipment on my desk etc etc.  There is still some work to do but on the short term I want to have gotten rid of everything I don't need, and keep what I need in the places that make most sense for them, and in the end I want to know where everything is (so I never need to search) and there should be nothing where it doesn't belong...</p>

<p>My parents had to stop me from starting to clean up our entire attic...  This book definitely has changed me.  (those who know how I used to leave my stuff will understand ;-)</p>

		<p>I had to fix a problem at <a href="http://www.plaetinck.be">my dad's company</a>...<br />

"The network was broken."</p>

<p>It was a NetBEUI network connecting some windows stations - it has been running for years - and now suddenly the nodes couldn't find eachother.<br />

One of the boxes (windows 2000 iirc) had 2 network cards, one for the network, the other not used for anything (not even connected).  Disabling the latter - not even touching the former - fixed half of the network.</p>

<p>There was another box that couldn't find any other node in the network.  This happened to be a box of which the ps/2 mouse broke.  It had a usb mouse connected but since it was windows 95 it was not supported.  I removed the usb mouse and attached another ps/2 mouse.  This fixed not only the mouse but also the box could suddenly find the other boxes again....</p>

<p>Windows really does suck.</p>

<p>And the worst part is: even though all is fine now, I have no clue for how long it will work, and what will be the cause the next time it will be broken?</p>

		<p>On 31-3-2008 <a href="http://www.lcl.be">LCL</a>, one of the most used datacenters in Belgium - and the only one with a 0% downtime record in Belgium - had major power issues with their datacenter in Diegem, bringing lots of Belgian parties offline.  (more specifics <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=lcl+diegem+power+failure">on the net</a>).</p>

<p>If you're one of the sysadmins of a website with 35M members and 150M hits per day this means you're in for an exciting night ...<!--more--></p>

<p>Long story short: LCL couldn't bring the power back up fast enough so we rented our own generator.  After rushing to Brussels we ( The Netlog ITS-team) could sit in the offices upstairs.  But after a while they had to close it down but we could stay in a room nearby (without furniture).   After that we went to Steven's appartment in Machelen.  We worked about 30 hours in a row, getting our sites back up and running (mostly fixing corrupted databases).  Our friends from the devteam also did some great achievements the next day, by using the redundancy of denormalized database layouts they could restore nearly all missing content that had vanished because of table repairs.</p>

		<p><b>UPDATE: this information is outdated.  See <a href="http://github.com/Dieterbe/ddm/tree/master" title="http://github.com/Dieterbe/ddm/tree/master">http://github.com/Dieterbe/ddm/tree/master</a> for latest information.</b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>If you have multiple sets of data (e.g.: music, images, documents, movies, ...) and you use these on more then one system ( e.g. a laptop and a file server) then you probably also have some 'rules' on how you use these on your systems.  For example after capturing new images you maybe put them on your laptop first but you like to sync them to your file server frequently.  On the other hand you also want all your high-res images (stored on the server) available for editing on the laptop, and to make it more complicated you might have the same images in a smaller format on your server (for gallery programs etc.) and want these (or a select few albums of them) available on the road. </p>

<p>The more different types of data you have and the more you have specific work flows the harder it becomes to keep your data as up to date as possible and consistent on your boxes.  You could manually rsync/(s)cp your data but you end up in having a mess (at least that's how it turned out on my boxes). Putting everything under version control is great for text files and such, but it's not an option for bigger (binary) files.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep all my stuff neatly organised in my home directories and I want to create good work flows with as minimum hassle as possible, so I decided to write DDM: the Distributed Data Manager.<!--more--></p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The code is far from finished.  Some features are still missing and there will be bugs in it.  I'm even still thinking about the concepts themselves.   Don't blame me if ddm deletes the wrong files or causes your computer to blow up.</p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<p>DDM is a bash script that manages your data, distributed over multiple (*nix) systems.  You tell it how you want to work with your data and ddm will do the copying, deleting, syncing, committing, updating, ... for you.<br />

It uses simple things like cp, rsync and svn for this.<br />

Configuration is done through simple text files that will be sourced.</p>

<p>Ddm works with repositories: these are data stores on your server which should never be edited by hand.  A repository can be a svn repository or something as simple as a directory shared over the network ( through NFS, SMB, ... )</p>

<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://wiki.autofs.net/">autoFS</a> as auto mounter.  It is very easy, yet powerful and flexible.</p>

<h4>Vocabulary</h4>

<ul>

<li>repotype: the type of your repo.  currently this is either 'svn' (subversion) or 'vfs' ( any position in your VFS, the underlying technology is up to you. although autofs+nfs will be most useful)</li>

<li>dataset name: The name of your dataset. e.g. 'movies'</li>

<li>dataset type (see below)</li>

<li>action: commit, update, checkout</li>

</ul>

<h4>Dataset types</h4>

<ul>

<li>selection: a copy of a subset of the data in the repo (e.g. your favourite movies of all your movies)</li>

<li>buffer: temporary storage to be flushed to the repo regularly (e.g. new images or stuff you just downloaded)</li>

<li>copy: (default): a copy of all content in the repo (an svn working copy or a directory using rsync)</li>

<li>extension: contains unique content that you don't want on your server (e.g. temporary files)</li>

<li>direct: a (symlink to a) local mount point for a remote location. useful for big collections</li>

</ul>

<p>So basically you tell ddm to perform an action on a dataset of a specific type.<br />

Note that some actions wouldn't make sense for some dataset types ( e.g. commit on a selection or extension) and thus don't need to be implemented, while others perform really basic operations (an update of a vfs copy is just an rsync) or just wrap around something else (notably the svn actions just wrap around the svn tool)<br />

Keep in mind though that everything can be overridden through .ddm files in dataset directories.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>Ddm is configured through:</p>

<ul>

<li>a .ddm file in your home directory. (needed)</li>

<li>a .ddm file in your dataset directories (optional)</li>

<li>the directory name of your dataset (read on) (optional)</li>

</ul>

<p>To specify the dataset type, the easiest way is to add suffixes to your directories. eg video-selection.  This is not a must and can be specified in the .ddm file in the dataset directory. For the 'copy' dataset type you don't need to specify anything (it's default)<br />

Unless overridden, ddm will construct the repo path as follows:  </p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">&lt;!<span style="color: #666666">[</span>CDATA<span style="color: #666666">[</span>

<span style="color: #19177C">$TYPE_BASE</span>/<span style="color: #19177C">$TYPE_PREFIX$DATASET_NAME$TYPE_SUFFIX</span>

<span style="color: #666666">]]</span>&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>(if unclear, read on)</p>

<p>In the .ddm file in your dataset directory you can override defaults.</p>

<h5>~/.ddm</h5>

<p>This is how my file looks like.</p>

dieter@dieter-mbp:~$ ddm -h

usage: ddm options



OPTIONS:

   -d                Dataset (name of directory)

   -h                Show this message

   -m                Message (used for commits in svn, ignored otherwise)

   -u                Update

   -o                Checkout (default repo type)

   -O <repo-type>    Checkout using specific repo type (one of: svn vfs)

   -t <dataset-type> Specify dataset-type (selection,copy, ...) (only honoured for checkouts)

   -v                Verbose

]]></pre><h4>Examples</h4>

<h5>Update my video-selection.</h5>

<p>The directory is ~/video-selection.  It contains episodes that I'm watching<br />

The .ddm file looks like this</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">&lt;!<span style="color: #666666">[</span>CDATA<span style="color: #666666">[</span>

<span style="color: #666666">}</span>

<span style="color: #666666">]]</span>&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>This means that ddm will look in my bash history and look for the movie files in this directory I have played (using "mplayer video-selection/*somefile*).<br />

It will then delete all the ones I've already seen, except the latest one (parameter 3). It will also fetch the next 10 episodes (parameter 2)</p>

Fosdem looks interesting again : talks about iogrind , scons , cakephp , virtualbox , openAFS , ...<br />

No Gentoo devroom this year but drupal , debian , embedded , X , gnome rooms would have interested me too ( mostly gtk/glib for the latter )</p>

<p>Oh and about the reason I'm not going?  The <a href="http://corporate.netlog.com">company</a> is taking us to <a href="http://www.valdisole.it/">Val di Sole</a> where we will ski, snowboard and apres-ski for 4 days !  w00t ! This kicks even more ass then Fosdem :P</p>

		<p>Yesterday, after a night of searching and fixing spelling errors, things that could be better explained and other small details,<br />

I got my thesis printed and delivered the six books to my school.<br />

<!--more--><br />

I updated the <a href="/masterproef">masterproef</a> page where you can now download the full 79 page report.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.lievendekeyser.net/">Lieven</a> for staying up late proposing corrections for my thesis.  ( He knows all about how it is for a student who still has to do some work in those last few hours... hehe )<br />

Also thanks <a href="http://blog.sanderfiers.com/">Sander</a>! He woke up at 7 'o clock to burn my CD's (my cd-burner is broken) and driving me to <a href="http://www.guthorel.be/kopieservice.html"> Guthorel copy center</a> ( who offer a great service btw!  And they were pretty cheap: 54 euro's for printing and binding 6 reports)<br />

Also thanks to Stefan for burning me that extra 7th disk which - apparently - was needed instead of 6 :p</p>

<p>Of course I have more people to thank, but they are already mentioned in my report ;-)</p>

<p>Now let's hope I get some good results for all the hard work that went into this ;-)</p>

		<p>I just signed my contract at <a href="http://incrowd.be/">Incrowd</a>, the company behind sites such as <a href="http://redbox.be/">redbox</a> and <a href="http://www.facebox.com/">facebox</a>.</p>

<p>I will be working there in a team of all young, enthusiastic people.  Among those, some people are already familiar to me:  my old friend <a href="http://www.lievendekeyser.net/">Lieven</a> (we've played in a band together but kept in touch afterwards) and my ex-classmate <a href="http://www.jurriaanpersyn.com/">Jurriaan</a>.  Both of them love their jobs btw :-).</p>

<p>My official title is "System &amp; Network architect".<br />

Things I will be doing there is <!--more--> keeping the "lower level" (hardware, network, databases) secure, stable and performing well.<br />

There will be quite some variety: working together with the dev-team, optimizing where possible, but also testing fancy hardware and software setups, hacking some code, deciding which routes we'll take and administering the systems.<br />

Of course it will be in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">sane</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard">environment</a> :-)  Otherwise I would never have signed.</p>

<p>Those who know me well will see that all this stuff is actually the kind of things I'm messing with in my spare time (among others of course), so these are things that I'm really interested in.  I'm anxious to start, I even already have a few ideas in my head for stuff I want to check/propose, but of course I'll have to wait a bit:  I have to finish my <a href="/masterproef">thesis</a>, then exams, then (hopefully ;-) ) graduate and after a small vacation my term starts.</p>

<p>PS: We (I can say this now ;-) are still hiring, check our <a href="http://incrowd.be/jobs.html">jobs</a> page.</p>

Twee man sterk (Steven en ik) vertegenwoordigden we <a href="http://www.jhsjatoo.org/">jeugdhuis SjaTOo</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Steven volgde "bekijk het nuchter", een beleidsthema dat de drugs- en alcoholproblematiek behandelt.  In eerste instantie leek "ik ben nieuw in de rvb" voor mij heel interessant.  Ik zit ondertussen wel bijna een jaar in de rvb, maar een goed overzicht van alle belangrijke factoren heb ik nog niet gehad.  Dit ging echter niet door wegens te weinig geinteresseerden.  Alhoewel ik Stevens thema het beste alternatief vond wou ik toch iets anders doen, kwestie van globaal gezien zoveel mogelijk informatie te vergaren (de meeste jeugdhuizen komen met 4 a 8 personen).  Dan heb ik voor "cre-activiteit" gekozen.  Een thema waarbij je originele activiteiten leert bedenken en hoe je best promotie kan voeren.  Leek mij wel interessant.</p>

<p>Zaterdagmorgen moesten we in Wetteren de trein van 8:24 hebben.  Opstaan om 7uur gaat nooit goed, zeker niet op zaterdag, en nog minder als je de avond ervoor actief gekwist hebt bij de <a href="http://users.skynet.be/ksjlaarne/">ksj laarne</a>.<br />

Maar goed, alles ging volgens plan: een lift met de auto, 2 treinritten, een busreis en een kleine ochtendwandeling verder arriveerden we stipt op tijd om 10u.</p>

<p>De sessies zelf vielen voor mij een beetje tegen.  Pas op, ik heb vanalles bijgeleerd, maar ik had meer verwacht.  Op zaterdag hebben we vooral ideeen uitgewisseld tussen de jeugdhuizen onderling om zo tot nieuwe, originele activiteiten te komen.  Wat dacht je van een "oma- en oparty" waarbij jongeren verkleed gaan als bejaarden, of avonden waarbij iedereen op een podium zit zodat ze een stuk hoger zitten dan de toog?  Op zondag hebben we heel kort gezien hoe je goeie affiches maakt en hebben we een kleine oefening gedaan over hoe je een originele uitnodiging maakt of promotie voert in het algemeen.  De rest van de tijd (ongeveer de helft van het totaal) was basically gevuld met spelletjes en gesprekken die weinig of geen verband houden met een jeugdhuis.  Dit vond ik zonde van de tijd.<br />

Stevens sessies waren heel hands-on en leerrijk, gaande van praktische workshops (hoe rol je een joint, hoe herken je iemand die drug x of y heeft gebruikt,...) tot het uitwisselen van ervaring en adviezen over hoe je je beleid kan vorm geven.<br />

Gelukkig krijgen we hier achteraf nog een "syllabus" van, die ik (en de rest van het bestuur, medewerkers,...) nog eens kunnen nalezen. </p>

<p>Een ander aspect, dat minstens even belangrijk is als de sessies op zich, zijn de collega's die je ontmoet, waarmee je tussendoor ideeen kan uitwisselen, discussieren, en natuurlijk ook genoeg minder serieus kan zijn ;-).<br />

Velen zien dit weekend dan ook meer als een soort vakantie (en daar zit de fuif op zaterdagavond ook wel voor iets tussen) en bekijken de sessies als plezante tussendoortjes.</p>

<p>Op zondagavond, na het afscheid van formaat en onze nieuwe kennissen werd het tijd om huiswaarts te keren.<br />

Gelukkig kregen we een lift van Stijn en Pieter van <a href="http://www.jeugdhuisplectrum.be/">jeugdhuis 't plectrum</a> want de uren van de verschillende treinen kwamen niet meer zo mooi overeen.<br />

Thuisgekomen redelijk vroeg het bed in, want wat extra slaap kon ik wel gebruiken.</p>

<p>Nog eens een Kwartee meedoen zie ik zeker zitten, hopelijk krijgen we de volgende keer nog wat meer volk (medewerkers) mee :-)<br />

En nu verder aan het eindwerk werken...</p>

		<p>Every year, during a special weekend in February, the <a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/">University Libre of Brussels</a> suddenly becomes a little more geeky.<br />

It's that time of the year when many European (and some inter-continental) colleagues join us at<br />

<a href="http://www.fosdem.org">Fosdem: the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting</a> (more info <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/about/fosdem">here</a>).</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/">This years edition</a> took place in the weekend of 24 - 2 - 2007.  And I was there, for the first time.  Saturday and Sunday :-)</p>

<p>Like usual the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/days">schedule</a> was pretty full, with lots of things happening at the same time, and only one thing a human being is able to attend at the same time.  Luckily however the 2 biggest rooms (Janson and Chavanne) were videotaped and the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/media/video">videos</a> are always made available online afterwards.  So knowing that, I could safely follow other rooms if I found those more interesting.</p>

<h3>Saturday</h3>

<p>The first talk started at 10:00h, and it's about an hour drive, if you don't get lost.<br />

But I need my sleep, especially the sparse kind of sleep after Friday evenings.  (same goes for my buddy <a href="http://ghosty.be/">Geert</a> who I could ride along with).  We headed off at 11h, and arrived somewhere around 12:30.  (Let's blame Brussels' bad road signaling for that).  </p>

<p>Missed the opening talks, and the "status of software patents" and "liberating java" talks which I'm was really interested in, but hey they were taped so no problemo ;-). During lunch break I explored the stands a bit, talked with some guys and picked up some reading material.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> stand there was no merchandise to be found.  I asked whether merch would arrive, but they said they were afraid not.  (and they were right).  No Gentoo merchandise, that was bummer.  I really wanted a t-shirt or something like that.  Gentoo is one of my favorite distros.</p>

<p>At the gnome stand they had made a panel were people could write their favorite things (or things they hate) about gnome on post-its.  There were things like "gnome should use QT" replied by "qt should use gtk" and all kinds of jokes.  Then there was this guy who was repositioning all the post-it's in the shape of letters of kde.  I use neither (I use <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">xfce</a>) but this sure was a cool place to hang out during breaks.  </p>

<p>After that I followed the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/xorg">X.org talk</a>, <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/keith+packard">Keith</a> (the project leader) was a real-funpants and told us all about the developers involved with Xorg.  Where they live, their tasks, favorite beers, and so on.  More of a talk for the community then the developers.</p>

<p>Next was <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/aiglx">the aiglx one</a>.  Actually I preferred attending <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/linuxbios">linuxBIOS</a> which I just find more interesting.  Besides, thanks to my nvidia card i can run GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap without aiglx or xgl, but hey, I guess the other guys are less fortunate so I decided to stick with them.  I can always check linuxBIOS later :-).   This talk was pretty advanced.  A real developers-talk you could say.  I certainly couldn't follow ;-)</p>

<p>After that came a talk about the state of <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/linux_kernel"> the Linux kernel</a>.  It was quite interesting, again, this was a talk aimed at developers, which I'm totally not, but I'm a bit familiar with the kernel (running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> and following <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/">kerneltrap</a> a bit has it advantages) so I could follow, more or less.</p>

<p>Next I followed <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/donators_return">the donators return</a> thing where people who donated (like me) can <a href="http://fosdem.org/2007/support/donate">win prizes</a>.  I didn't win anything but hey, still I felt the money was well spent.  (and I also got a free t-shirt ;-) )  One of <a href="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/">these</a> would certainly fit in my room though ;-))</p>

<p>One thing I just had to attend was the Gentoo devroom.  like I said: Gentoo is one of my favorite distributions.  Also, it was our Belgian irc-friend <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/dimitry+bradt">Dimitry (aka diox)</a> who gave his talk so I just couldn't miss <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_future_discussion">his talk about Gentoo's future</a>.  This was the first devroom I followed and it was totally different then any other talk: it was more of an interactive talk between the devs and the audience.  In the audience were some real devs, but also lot's of "normal" communitypeople.  Next to me there even was a guy who was very new to Gentoo.  I was happy to tell him all about paludis, overlays and other concepts and terms of Gentoo.</p>

<p>After that, there were no more talks to attend, so I went by some stands again (to check if Gentoo merchandise might have arised, among others), met Geert again and, although it was pretty hard to find our way back in the (now darkened) city of Brussels, we managed to drive back home.</p>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>A new day, and wow, so many cool talks to attend: metasploit, drupal, security testing, mozilla, mono, gplv3, the list goes on.  Luckily many of them were in Janson/Chavanne so I could safely skip these and head for...</p>

<p>the Gentoo devroom.  (yeah, sorry, Gentoo here Gentoo there.  My other favorite distro <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> wasn't featured anywhere, so Gentoo got all the attention)<br />

I missed the "programing with paludis" one (ouch! I would have liked that one) but I was there to hear <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/mike+frysinger">Mike</a> talk about <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_council">Gentoo's inner workings</a>.  He told us all about Gentoo's history and how (by who) the project is managed.  That Daniel (the founder of Gentoo) left and came back (I found it remarkable he didn't mention <em>why</em> he left (to work at Microsoft).    Guess that wasn't important enough for the community)</p>

<p>After that <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/chris+gianelloni">Chris</a> talked about <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_tinderbox_testing">the process that happens for making releases</a>.  I was impressed.</p>

<p>To fill the gap between 13h and 14h I wanted to follow <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/jabber_oneteam">this</a> talk.  I have no idea what oneteam is, but I like jabber.  The room was stuffed with people though, and when opening the door you literally felt warm air coming out, so I decided to let the jabber guys in their oven :-)</p>

<p>After that some more Gentoo talks: <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_community_distro">"what makes Gentoo a community based distribution"</a> by <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/christel+dahlksjaer">Christel</a> didn't make me believe Gentoo is any more community based then most other open source Linux distributions, but hey Christel was quite a joker and the community vibe in the room was nice.</p>

<p>After that <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/marius+mauch">Marius</a> did a <em>great</em> job explaining the ins and outs of portage -especially the new ones- in his talk <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_portage">Portage: a look under the surface</a>.</p>

<p>After that <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/alexander+faeroey">Alexander</a> did a talk called <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/gentoo_bugday">future of the bugday project</a>.  This was pretty much the kind of information you get by reading the forums/newsletters.  Nothing new, but I don't think the talk intended to make groundbreaking revelations either ;-)</p>

<p>17 'o clock.  Damn.. time went fast.. Fosdem pretty much coming to end, luckily there was another nice topic I was really interested in: <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/embedded_security_devices">Linux on embedded security devices</a>.  This talk wasn't very good though:   No kernel revelations.  No open source code.  No in-depth explanations.<br />

Basically a company showing it's product: an embedded device running Linux, running customized code and a presentation showing a scheme showing where they used technologies like SSL, dns or dhcp.  Boring...  And a little demo.<br />

Nice to see, but nothing more then that.</p>

<p>I think it must have been after this talk I went back to the stands to find <a href="http://christophe.vandeplas.com/">Christophe (aka chri)</a>, who I hadn't met yet but I had helped him a bit getting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/weids/">weids, the "Webbased Information Display System"</a> (which was created for fosdem) to work.<br />

After talking some time with chri the <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation: Europe</a> got my attention, and I couldn't resist buying one of their lovely t-shirts.  I can't remember how much it cost me, but it was pretty expensive.  No problem though, as I know the money is in very good hands.</p>

<p>After that me and Geert drunk a beer, and then drove home again.</p>

<p>Fosdem was good.</p>

<h2>Did you know...?</h2>

<ul>

<li>I invited the <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> guys to come?  Unfortunately none of them came, but maybe I can convince them next year!</li>

<li>The catering was allright and very, very cheap (and also run by volunteers)</li>

<li>Fosdem is mentioned in this <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20070305-newsletter.xml">Gentoo newsletter</a>.  Including a picture of all the devs, shot by SeJo (sunday afternoon iirc)</li>

<li>You'll find many pictures <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/media/pictures">here</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Most of the talks are aimed at developers, and developers certainly are the guys that should come.  Fosdem is the perfect place to meet, discuss (with both developers of your own team, as with devs of other projects that you depend on), learn and hack some code together.</p>

<p>For the community it's another story.  Many of the talks are too hard to follow, and those talks that are aimed at the community usually don't offer more information then what you would find on the websites, forums/mailinglists or newsletters.<br />

The fact that you can download lots of video material is great.  If you stay home you can still make up for it by watching the movies.<br />

It's cool to meet people though.  And if you want to visit stands of different projects (for example to buy merchandise).  That's imho the best reason for non-developers to come to fosdem.  But that's personal of course.</p>

<p>So who's coming with me to fosdem 2008? :-).</p>
