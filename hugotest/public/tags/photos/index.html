		A post about the magnificent <a href="http://darktable.org/">darktable</a> photo manager/editor and why I'm abandoning <a href="/pixie.html">pixie</a>



<!--more-->

<br/>

<br/>



<p>

When I wrote <a href="/pixie.html">pixie</a>, I was aware of <a href="http://darktable.org/">darktable</a>.

It looked like a neat application with potential to be pretty much what I was looking for, although it

also looked complicated, mainly due to terminology like "darkroom" and "lighttable", which was a bit off-putting to me

and made me feel like the application was meant for photo professionals and probably wouldn't work well with

the ideals of a techie with some purist views on how to manage files and keep my filesystems clean.

</p> 

<p> 

Basically I didn't want to give the application a proper chance and then rationalized the decision after I made it.

I'm sure psychologists have a term for this behavior.  I try to be aware of these cases and not to fall in the trap,

but this time I was very aware of it and still proceeded, but I think I had a reasonable excuse.

I wanted an app that behaves exactly how I like, I wanted to play with angularjs, it seemed like a fun learning exercise to implement a full-stack program backed by a Go api server and an angularjs interface, with some keybind features and vim-like navigation sprinkled on top.

</p>

<p>

Pixie ended up working, but I got fed up with some angularjs issues, slow js performance and a list of to-do's i would need to address before i

would consider pixie feature complete, so only as of a few days ago I started giving darktable the chance it had deserved from the beginning.

<br/>

As it turns out, darktable is actually a fantastic application, and despite some imperfections, the difference is clear enough for me to abandon pixie.</p>

<p>

Here's why I like it:

<ol>

<li>

It stays true to my ideals:  It doesn't modify your files at all, this is a must for easily synchronizing photo archives with each other and with devices.

You can tag, assign metadata, create edits, etc. and re-size on export.  It stores metadata in a simple sqlite database, and also in xmp files which it puts along with the original files, but luckily you can easily ignore those while syncing.  (I have yet to verify whether you can adjust dates or set GPS info without modifying the actual files, but I had no solution for that either)

</li>

<li>basically, it's just well thought out and works well.  the terminology thing is a non-issue.  Just realize that lighttable means the set of pictures in your collection you want to work with, darkroom is the editor where you edit the image, and film roll is a directory with imported images.   Everything else is intuitive</li>

<li>It has decent tag editing features, and a powerful mechanism to build a selection of images using a variety of criteria using exif data, tags, GPS info, labels, etc. You can make duplicates of an image and make different edits, and treat them as images of their own</li>

<li>It has <a href="http://www.darktable.org/usermanual/ch06s03.html.php">pretty extensive key binding options</a>, and even provides a <a href="http://darktable.org/redmine/projects/darktable/wiki/LuaUsage">lua api</a> so you can hook in your own plugins.  People are working on a bunch of <a href="http://darktable.org/redmine/projects/darktable/wiki/LuaScripts">scripts</a> already.</li>

<li>It's fast. Navigating a 33k file archive, adjusting thumbnail sizes on the fly, iterating fast, works well</li>

<li>It has good support for non-destructive editing.  It has a variety of editing possibilities, as if it was commercial software</li>

<li>It has <a href="http://www.darktable.org/usermanual/index.html.php">complete documentation</a>, a <a href="http://www.darktable.org/category/blog/">great blog</a> with plenty of <a href="http://www.darktable.org/tag/tutorial/">tutorial articles</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmvlUro_Up1NBX7VK8UUuyWo1B468zEA0">tutorial videos</a></li>

</ol>

</p>

<p>

I did notice some bugs (including a few crashes), but there's always a few developers and community members active, on IRC and the bug tracker, so it's pretty active project and I'm confident/hopeful my issues will be resolved soon.

<!--

Finally I'd love to declare all my exports in a config file (collect files with these tags, export re-sized versions to directory X, etc) rather then this being manual, explicit actions. -->

<br/>I also have a few more ideas for features that would make it closer to my ideals, but as it stands, darktable is already a great application and I'm happy I can deprecate pixie at this point.

I even <a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe/tmsu-to-darktable">wrote a script</a> that automatically does all tag assignments in darktable based on the pixie information in tmsu, to make the transition friction free.

		So you have a few devices with pictures, and maybe some additional pictures your friends sent you.  You have a lot of pictures of the same thing and probably too high of a resolution.  Some may require some editing.  How do you easily create photo albums out of this mess?  And how do you do it in a way

that keeps a simple and elegant, yet flexible file/directory layout for portability and simplicity?

<!--more-->

<br/>

<br/>I couldn't find a tool that I liked, so I rolled my own: <a href="https://github.com/Dieterbe/pixie">Pixie</a>.

<br/>

It gives you vim-like keybindings to navigate pictures, create edits (stored in a "mirror directory") and add/remove tags to pictures.  (Because n:m tag relationships are basically a must for organizing things and don't work on any common filesystem)

To generate "album" directories, just define which tags they should(n't) match and run the script that synchronizes an export directory by symlinking (or resizing) the correct files into them.

Note the source directory stays unaltered so you can easily keep syncing with devices and/or people.

<br/>What used to be a pain in the butt for me is now a pretty pleasant experience.

<br/>Does this workflow make sense to you? Is this useful to you? Why (not) ?

<h3>Thailand</h3>

In July I did a 3-week group journey through Thailand arranged by <a href="http://www.explorado.be">Explorado</a>, but organized by ("outsourced to") the 2 guides of <a href="http://www.rootsofasia.com/">roots of Asia</a>, who did <a href="http://www.rootsofasia.com/get-to-know-us/feedback.html">an amazing job</a>.

The whole concept was exploring "the real Thailand" by means of <i>Eco-tourism</i>.  We've been in Bangkok (twice), Chiang Mai city, a mountain village in the province of Chiang Mai, through the jungle, at a fisherman village in Phuket and at the tropical island of Koh Pha ngan.

The latter was at the end of the trip and was timed perfectly to get some deserved rest in a more touristy (although not too busy) area, but the majority of the trip was spent far away from the typical touristy areas so we could be submerged in honest, authentic Thai culture and visit authentic locations, often we were at locations where seeing a group of white folks is not common.

We've been at unique authentic temples, stayed with various locals and hill tribes, shared meals with them, took the same transport they did (at one point an entire village collected their bikes so we could borrow them to do a bike trip through rice fields and some of the most beautiful lakes I've ever seen).  We've had plenty of beautiful moments during those 3 weeks.  Like visiting the home of one of the local Thai who built his entire house out of clay, by himself and some friends, or visiting the ancient temple where our guide got married, in a forest in the hills, it was the most beautiful temple of the entire trip, but no other tourists go there because it's not really known (and should probably be kept that way).  Or going to a bar in Chiang Mai city (one evening on my own, the next I brought a fellow traveler) to have some good times with some locals.

The Eco-conscious part of the travel means:

<ul>

<li>green travel (minimize impact on the environment, "leave no trace").  Other than taking the plane over there and back we did a pretty good job, we've used public buses, night trains, biodegradable soap, etc</li>

<li>local foods (no import, minimal packaging, wrap in banana leaves, etc)</li>

<li>supporting Eco-conscious projects (like <a href="http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/">elephant nature park</a>, which is an entire volunteer-based reserve to give mistreated elephants (which has been a big problem in Thailand) a better life, where we washed and fed elephants)</li>

</ul>

This has been a great experience, and although I found the culture in the South disgustingly based on profiting from tourists, and the cities are too polluted and dirty, I've seen cultures so respectful of nature and each other, living by values I've been trying to apply at home - but being frowned upon in our western society because we're so brainwashed by consumerism, which was beautiful and heartwarming.

<h3>Berlin</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/berlin_reichstag.jpg" alt="Berlin Reichstag building" height="150px"/>

I've been in Berlin for the first <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu/">Velocity conference in the EU</a>, which was quite good.  The best part was probably the "Velocity Birds of feather" (whatever that means) unconference the day before at <a href="http://betahaus.de">betahaus</a>, which was great for meeting some folks such as the <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a> guys (which BTW, is the site we host our music on), although lots more interesting folks attended the conference itself (and it was packed).

Berlin itself was nice too.  Lots of history (Berlin wall, world war(s)), lots of impressive architecture (old and new), very cheap (albeit mediocre in quality) food, lots of Italian food, a bit cold though.



<h3 style="clear: left;">New York city</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/brooklyn_bridge.jpg" alt="Brooklyn bridge" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/manhattan_harbor.jpg" alt="Manhattan harbor" height="150px"/>

I'm still recovering from the awesome time I just had in NYC. I've been way more busy over there than I anticipated. I should have stayed 2 or 3 weeks instead of 1 :).  I've met various locals (one of whom who'd love to become a city guide as 2nd job because she just loves showing people around, so that just turned out great!). I didn't go for the typical touristy things (I skipped things like the WTC memorial, empire state building, statue of liberty, to the extent you can skip them, as they are very visible from pretty much all over the place).

Instead, I wanted to get a feel of the real city and the people inhabiting it.  I've seen parts of Queens, central and North-West Brooklyn, lots of areas (but not enough) in Manhattan and even Staten Island, been to a rock concert, comedy, improv and cabaret shows, the movies, more bars than I can count and mostly ate out with company (just as real new yorkers do, of course, though for breakfast that feels a bit weird).  I even went shopping (not mall-shopping, but groceries in the supermarket, the Williamsburg Foodtown - that's what it's called - clerk advised me to enjoy every last second in the US, phrased in a way as if any other place in the world sucks in comparison, which is ridiculous, but turns out I followed his advice anyway) because I stayed at an apartment in Williamsburg, I also had 2 roommates, with whom I ironically couldn't spend as much time as I wanted to as I was so busy meeting up with all those other people, I also visited the Etsy and Vimeo offices (both are awesome) and met up with Dave Reisner (who is one of our latest Arch Linux devs, and who lives in NJ, but don't tell anyone) and who forgot to show me around in the Google office ;-)  And I realize some of the past sentences are a bit long and busy but that's one of the things I learned at New York I guess.  For one week, I almost lived like a real New Yorker, and it was interesting (but exhausting).



<h3 style="clear: left;">Move to Ghent</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/ghent_bridge.jpg" alt="Ghent, bridge of Sint-Michiels" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/ghent_coupure.jpg" alt="Ghent, coupure" height="150px"/>

Enough about the trips.  Back to daily life.  I moved to the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent</a>.  Riding by bike to work every day along the scenic <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupure_%28Gent%29">Coupure</a> is fun.

I am quite proud to say nearly all of my stuff in this apartment is second hand and I've been lucky to receive some free stuff as well (thanks Bram!).  Not (only) because I'm <span style="text-decoration:line-through">cheap</span> money conscious but I like to give things a second life instead of buying something new, lowering the impact on the environment. Even if it doesn't look too well, as long as it's functional.  And this is exactly one of those values I mentioned above which is often not understood in our Western society but I was pleased to find out this philosophy is the standard in large parts of Thai culture.



<h3 style="clear: left;">Death metal</h3>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/li_promoshoot.jpg" alt="Promo shoot" height="150px"/>

<img style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" src="/files/li_frontline.jpg" alt="Live @ Frontline, Ghent" height="150px"/>

We've done 3 gigs (which had great reception, luckily) and we've got planned a few already for 2012, one of which will be at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/From-Rock-Till-Core/141364465969247">From Rock Till Core festival</a> in Merelbeke.

We also did a semi-professional <a href="http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/album_promoshoot_summer_2011">photo-shoot</a>, and I made a <a href="http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/">website</a> (you can tell I'm not a designer).

<br style="clear: left;" />

<br/>

<br/>

That wraps up 2011 for me. Good times.. Happy new year everybody!
