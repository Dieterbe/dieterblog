Hi there, visitor.
My name is Dieter Plaetinck.
<br/>I enjoy backend programming, performance optimisation (in a very broad sense), music, drums, travel, structured data processing, sharing and learning.
<br/>There's a time and a place for everything in life, so I to be strategic about focusing on one or two things at a time.
<br/>Right now it's mainly backend programming in Go and python, telemetry (timeseries processing, analytics, visualisation) and that's what I blog about the most.  But you can find some other things on here too.

<br/>
<br/>
I had a blast working on <a href="/tag/netlog">netlog</a>, a large social network in Europe, but we lost the battle against facebook.  Nowadays I work on the backend of <a href="/tag/vimeo">vimeo</a>, the high quality video sharing website, where I focus on telemetry and big data.
Some people still know me from the <a href="/tag/uzbl">Uzbl</a> minimalist web browser or my work on the <a href="/tag/arch">Arch Linux installer and releases</a> or my <a href="http://stopabusingsiprefixes.org/">stop abusing SI prefixes</a> website. (One of my pet peeves is correct application of terminology and concepts, I see this as a requirement for calling yourself an engineer or scientist)
<br/>
<br/>Nowadays my open source efforts revolve mostly around <a href="/tag/monitoring">monitoring (telemetry)</a> projects, and in specific the <a href="http://metrics20.org/">metrics 2.0</a> standardisation effort for timeseries metadata.
