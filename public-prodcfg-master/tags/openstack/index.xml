It provides a central management interface which leverages chef, but extends it to a broader scope: it takes care of configuring the bios and raid firmware, BMC/IPMI, doing a PXE autoinstall and setting up chef, which of course does everything else you might need.
&lt;br/&gt;The crowbar admin machine also runs Nagios and Ganglia and the configuration is automatically kept in sync with the roles you apply to your nodes. (adding support for a different monitoring/alerting solution is probably not too hard.  I&#39;m thinking about graphite support or even integrating with an existing graphite setup)
&lt;br/&gt;It uses a plugin system called barclamps and it&#39;s vendor-agnostic.  (minus the barclamps that deal with your hardware)
It can even suggest roles for your nodes based on best practices (like: for an X-node openstack cluster we recommend Y proxy&#39;s and Z foobars) and hardware properties it discovers (storage vs cpu power vs ram etc)
&lt;br/&gt;Next step would be automating purchase orders, delivery handling and physical installation in racks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this tool deserves more attention and should be added to your devops toolchain for the cloud (&lt;i&gt;triple buzzword bonus!!!&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve currently been using it to easily setup an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar/wiki/Swift--barclamp&#34;&gt;openstack swift&lt;/a&gt; test cluster on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar/wiki/Running-Crowbar-in-VirtualBox-VMs&#34;&gt;a virtualbox infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; (even the latter is easily automated with a shell script), and I&#39;m looking forward to use it on physical hardware and have it take care of the bios and raid settings, I&#39;m expecting it will even set the LCD&#39;s on the frontpanel to something interesting automatically. (btw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/poweredge&#34;&gt;12G poweredge servers&lt;/a&gt; have some neat new features)
&lt;/p&gt;
