      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Goodbye Vimeo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s never been as hard saying goodbye to the people and the work environment as it is now.
&lt;br/&gt;
Vimeo was created by dedicated film creators and enthusiasts, just over 10 years ago, and today it still shows.
From the quirky, playful office culture, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/staff&#34;&gt;the staff created short films&lt;/a&gt;,
to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/categories&#34;&gt;tremendous curation effort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/videos&#34;&gt;staff picks&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=&#34;http://websta.me/p/797128421285501516_12986477&#34;&gt;monthly staff screenings&lt;/a&gt; where we get to see the best of the best videos on the Internet each month,
to the dedication towards building the best platform and community on the web to enjoy videos and the uncompromising commitment to supporting movie creators and working in their best interest.
&lt;br/&gt;Engineering wise, there has been plenty of opportunity to make an impact and learn.
&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless, I have to leave and I&#39;ll explain why.  First I want to mention a few more things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/bye_vimeo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;vimeo goodbye drink&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Belgium I used to hitchhike to and from work so that each day brought me opportunities to have conversations with a diverse, fantastic assortment of people.  I still fondly remember some of those memories. (and it was also usually faster than taking the bus!)
&lt;br/&gt;Here in NYC this isn&#39;t really feasible, so I tried the next best thing.  A mission to have lunch with every single person in the company, starting with those I don&#39;t typically interact with.  I managed to have lunch with 95 people, get to know them a bit, find some gems of personalities and anecdotes, and have conversations on a tremendous variety of subjects, some light-hearted, some deep and profound.  It was fun and I hope to be able to keep doing such social experiments in my new environment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vimeo is also part of my life in an unusually personal way.  When I came to New York (my first ever visit to the US) in 2011 to interview, I also met a pretty fantastic woman in a random bar in Williamsburg. We ended up traveling together in Europe, I decided to move the US and we moved in together.  I&#39;ve had the pleasure of being submerged in both American and Greek culture for the last few years, but the best part is that today we are engaged and I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.  While I&#39;ve tried to keep work and personal life somewhat separate, Vimeo has made an undeniable ever lasting impact on my life that I&#39;m very grateful for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Vimeo I found an area where a bunch of my interests converge: operational best practices, high performance systems, number crunching, statistics and open source software.  Specifically, timeseries metrics processing in the context of monitoring.  While I have enjoyed my opportunity &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/tags/monitoring/&#34;&gt;to make contributions in this space&lt;/a&gt; to help our teams and other companies who end up using my tools, I want to move out of the cost center of the company, I want to be in the department that creates the value.  If I want to focus on open source monitoring, I should align my incentives with those of my employer.  Both for my and their sake.
&lt;b&gt;I want to make more profound contributions to the space.  The time has come for me to join a company for which the main focus is making open source monitoring better.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello raintank!&lt;/h2&gt;
Over the past two years or so I&#39;ve talked to many people in the industry about monitoring, many of them trying to bring me into their team.
I never found a perfect fit but as we transitioned from 2014 into 2015, the stars seemingly aligned for me.
Here&#39;s why I&#39;m very excited to join the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raintank.io/&#34;&gt;raintank&lt;/a&gt; crew:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m a strong believer in open source.  I believe fundamental infrastructure tooling should be modifiable and in your control.  It&#39;s partially a philosophical argument, but also what I believe will separate long lasting business from short term successes.
&lt;br/&gt;SaaS is great, but not if it&#39;s built to lock you in.  In this day and age, I think you should &#34;lock in&#34; your customers by providing a great experience they can&#39;t say no to, not by having them build technical debt as they integrate into your stack.
&lt;br/&gt;That said, integrating with open source also incurs technical debt, and some closed source service providers are so good that the debt is worth it.  But I don&#39;t believe this lasts long term, especially given the required pricing models.  I think you can entice customers more by lowering the debt they build up (i.e. use standardized protocols, tooling and making it easy for them to leave) as they adopt your service.
&lt;!-- I was really interested in datadog for example.  I liked the team, I liked the product they are/were building and I saw they would become successfull, but it&#39;s not the kind of business I want to build towards long term. --&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;raintank&#39;s commitment to open source is not a gimmick but stems from a fundamental conviction that 100% open source is the right thing to do.  That by providing freedom, you get loyalty.
I think they came up with a good business model that combines the benefits of SaaS with those of open source.  At least it&#39;s a bet I want to take.
It&#39;s not an easy feat but I think we got a good formula. (basically openSAAS, the stack is open source, integrates in the wider ecosystem, you can run it yourself, you own your data, you can use our SAAS, or create a mixed setup.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/131790481&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something I value a lot in coworkers, besides &#34;technical&#34; abilities is emotional intelligence and professional maturity.  Part of me thinks it&#39;s a vastly underestimated quality in general, although perhaps I just happen to find it more important than average.  Either way, the new team seems solid on both fronts.  I&#39;m mostly impressed by the founder/CEO Raj Dutt who has shown a very personal and graceful approach.
	Strong high-stakes relationships with people in general, and coworkers in particular are a very worthy pursuit and two months in I can still vouch for the level of alignment and maturity that I haven&#39;t experienced before.
	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/20150429_194521_HDR.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Yours truly and Raj Dutt&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I (and my fiancee) want to see the world. The common conception that significant leisure travel can&#39;t be combined with hard, or even normal amounts of work seems so backwards to me.  Today more than ever, we have globalization, we are developing a sharing economy (airbnb, lyft, ...).  There&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t do great work while enjoying our personal time to the fullest.  Working remotely, and/or with remote colleagues requires more discipline but I simply only want to work with disciplined people.  Working on a fixed schedule, in a fixed office location is needlessly arcane, constrained and inefficient. It puts a damper on life.
		Almost all software companies I know see open office plans as a great thing, but it&#39;s usually an attempt at compensating for employee&#39;s poor communication skills, forcing them
		to talk to the detriment of people who need focus and get distracted.  Isolation of workers does not preclude healthy communication and collaboration.
		I get a lot more done in isolation, with sync-ups and face-to-face when appropriate, especially if it&#39;s on my schedule. Working remote is a great way to facilitate this and I&#39;m happy that raintank not only agrees with the idea, but actually encourages travel, and encourages me to follow whatever time allocation works best for me.
		I work hard but we travel where ever we want, we&#39;ll have plenty of time to spend with our families in Belgium and Cyprus.  And yet I don&#39;t think I ever worked this closely with anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/office_shasta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;office mount shasta&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve always wanted to be in a company from the start and experience the &#34;true&#34; start-up feel.  I have a lot of opinions on organization, culture, and product and so I&#39;m glad to have the opportunity to make that kind of impact as well.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OK, so what am I really up to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grafana is &lt;a href=&#34;http://play.grafana.org/dashboard/db/stats&#34;&gt;pretty much the leading open source metrics dashboard&lt;/a&gt; right now.
So it only makes sense that raintank is a heavy Grafana user and contributor.
My work, logically, revolves around codifying some of the experience and ideas I have, and making
them accessible through the polished interface that is Grafana, which now also has a full time UX designer working on it.
Since according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://infogr.am/grafana_user_survey_mar2015&#34;&gt;Grafana user survey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;alerting is the most sorely missed non-feature of Grafana&lt;/b&gt;,
we are working hard on rectifying this and it is my full-time focus.  If you&#39;ve followed my blog you know I have some thoughts on where the sweet spot lies in clever alerting.
In short, take the claims of anomaly detection via machine learning with a big grain of salt, and instead, focus on enabling operators to express complex logic simply, quickly,
and in an agile way.  My latest favorite project, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bosun.org/&#34;&gt;bosun&lt;/a&gt; exemplifies this approach (highly recommend giving this a close look).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The way I&#39;m thinking of it now, the priorities (and sequence of focus) for alerting within Grafana will probably be something like this:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cover the low hanging fruit: simple threshold checks with email notifications actually go a long way&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;gradually provide more power and sophistication (reduction functions, boolean logic, etc), while keeping things in a nice UI&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;provide full-on integration with advanced alerting systems such as Bosun. Iterative workflow, Signal/noise analysis, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

There&#39;s a lot of thought work, UX and implementation details around this topic,
I&#39;ve created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/2209&#34;&gt;github ticket&lt;/a&gt; to kick off a discussion and am curious to hear your thoughts.

Finally, if any of this sounds interesting to you, you can sign up to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grafana.org/&#34;&gt;grafana newsletter&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://raintank.io/&#34;&gt;raintank newsletter&lt;/a&gt; which will get you info on the open source platform as well
as the SaaS product.  Both are fairly low volume.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;!--
some reminisic about meeting up with torkel and talking buziness models in pdx
 how i see myself integrating in the team:
the way I see it, there&#39;s some good, next-gen ideas and implementation in some of the things i&#39;ve built and/or have experience with (metrics2.0, graph-explorer, bosun) but clearly some of these projects (esp the former two) have been handicapped by a steep learning curve and weak UX.  Part of the reason I&#39;m excited in joining in RT is that over time I will be able to gently infuse some of these re-envisioned ideas into the grafana package, with a much higher focus on user friendlyness.
nyc skin issues
alternative funding? crowd etc

      <title>Moving to New York City</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/moving-to-nyc/</link>

      <guid>moving-to-nyc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have a one-way ticket to NYC on Sept. 21st.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/about&#34;&gt;Vimeo HQ&lt;/a&gt; is in Manhattan, and practically the whole team works in the building so it makes sense for me to relocate and join them locally.
I&#39;m looking forward to working with the colleagues face to face, but mainly I&#39;m looking forward to the experience of living in such a different place, and exploring the US.
In fact, I already have some small trips planned (Hamptons NY, camping in Pennsylvania, skiing in New York this winter) with some friends &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/thailand_berlin_velocity_nyc_ghent_metal.html&#34;&gt;I met last year in NY&lt;/a&gt;.
We&#39;re also looking into possibly going to California or Mexico for the holidays.
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#39;ve been living in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent&#34;&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; for about a year now and absolutely loved it.  I&#39;ll definitely miss Ghent, I think NYC might be a bit too hectic for my taste, but I just &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to try this and see :)  There&#39;s so much to learn and explore.
I especially have high expectations of the music scene, which I&#39;ld like to get involved in. (btw my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/&#34;&gt;ex-band&lt;/a&gt; is recording an EP and looking for a new drummer)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;35%&#34; src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/travel_documents_nyc.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for things in Belgium: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151066748715279.458359.627030278&amp;type=3&amp;l=1fa8adec26&#34;&gt;selling furniture&lt;/a&gt;, moving out of my apartment next weekend, having a goodbye drink friday sept. 14th, flying a week later and returning in the summer 2013 for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gentsefeesten.be/&#34;&gt;gentse feesten&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe I&#39;ll visit sooner, depending on how homesick I get :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thailand, Berlin Velocity EU, NYC, Ghent and more metal</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/thailand_berlin_velocity_nyc_ghent_metal/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2012 18:10:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>thailand_berlin_velocity_nyc_ghent_metal</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to write about a lot of stuff in separate posts, but they kept getting delayed, so I&#39;ll just briefly share everything in one post.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thailand&lt;/h3&gt;
In July I did a 3-week group journey through Thailand arranged by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.explorado.be&#34;&gt;Explorado&lt;/a&gt;, but organized by (&#34;outsourced to&#34;) the 2 guides of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rootsofasia.com/&#34;&gt;roots of Asia&lt;/a&gt;, who did &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rootsofasia.com/get-to-know-us/feedback.html&#34;&gt;an amazing job&lt;/a&gt;.
The whole concept was exploring &#34;the real Thailand&#34; by means of &lt;i&gt;Eco-tourism&lt;/i&gt;.  We&#39;ve been in Bangkok (twice), Chiang Mai city, a mountain village in the province of Chiang Mai, through the jungle, at a fisherman village in Phuket and at the tropical island of Koh Pha ngan.
The latter was at the end of the trip and was timed perfectly to get some deserved rest in a more touristy (although not too busy) area, but the majority of the trip was spent far away from the typical touristy areas so we could be submerged in honest, authentic Thai culture and visit authentic locations, often we were at locations where seeing a group of white folks is not common.
We&#39;ve been at unique authentic temples, stayed with various locals and hill tribes, shared meals with them, took the same transport they did (at one point an entire village collected their bikes so we could borrow them to do a bike trip through rice fields and some of the most beautiful lakes I&#39;ve ever seen).  We&#39;ve had plenty of beautiful moments during those 3 weeks.  Like visiting the home of one of the local Thai who built his entire house out of clay, by himself and some friends, or visiting the ancient temple where our guide got married, in a forest in the hills, it was the most beautiful temple of the entire trip, but no other tourists go there because it&#39;s not really known (and should probably be kept that way).  Or going to a bar in Chiang Mai city (one evening on my own, the next I brought a fellow traveler) to have some good times with some locals.
The Eco-conscious part of the travel means:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;green travel (minimize impact on the environment, &#34;leave no trace&#34;).  Other than taking the plane over there and back we did a pretty good job, we&#39;ve used public buses, night trains, biodegradable soap, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local foods (no import, minimal packaging, wrap in banana leaves, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting Eco-conscious projects (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/&#34;&gt;elephant nature park&lt;/a&gt;, which is an entire volunteer-based reserve to give mistreated elephants (which has been a big problem in Thailand) a better life, where we washed and fed elephants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This has been a great experience, and although I found the culture in the South disgustingly based on profiting from tourists, and the cities are too polluted and dirty, I&#39;ve seen cultures so respectful of nature and each other, living by values I&#39;ve been trying to apply at home - but being frowned upon in our western society because we&#39;re so brainwashed by consumerism, which was beautiful and heartwarming.
&lt;br/&gt;

I&#39;ve been in Berlin for the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu/&#34;&gt;Velocity conference in the EU&lt;/a&gt;, which was quite good.  The best part was probably the &#34;Velocity Birds of feather&#34; (whatever that means) unconference the day before at &lt;a href=&#34;http://betahaus.de&#34;&gt;betahaus&lt;/a&gt;, which was great for meeting some folks such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soundcloud.com&#34;&gt;soundcloud.com&lt;/a&gt; guys (which BTW, is the site we host our music on), although lots more interesting folks attended the conference itself (and it was packed).
Berlin itself was nice too.  Lots of history (Berlin wall, world war(s)), lots of impressive architecture (old and new), very cheap (albeit mediocre in quality) food, lots of Italian food, a bit cold though.

&lt;h3 style=&#34;clear: left;&#34;&gt;New York city&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img style=&#34;float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;&#34; src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/brooklyn_bridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Brooklyn bridge&#34; height=&#34;150px&#34;/&gt;

I&#39;m still recovering from the awesome time I just had in NYC. I&#39;ve been way more busy over there than I anticipated. I should have stayed 2 or 3 weeks instead of 1 :).  I&#39;ve met various locals (one of whom who&#39;d love to become a city guide as 2nd job because she just loves showing people around, so that just turned out great!). I didn&#39;t go for the typical touristy things (I skipped things like the WTC memorial, empire state building, statue of liberty, to the extent you can skip them, as they are very visible from pretty much all over the place).
Instead, I wanted to get a feel of the real city and the people inhabiting it.  I&#39;ve seen parts of Queens, central and North-West Brooklyn, lots of areas (but not enough) in Manhattan and even Staten Island, been to a rock concert, comedy, improv and cabaret shows, the movies, more bars than I can count and mostly ate out with company (just as real new yorkers do, of course, though for breakfast that feels a bit weird).  I even went shopping (not mall-shopping, but groceries in the supermarket, the Williamsburg Foodtown - that&#39;s what it&#39;s called - clerk advised me to enjoy every last second in the US, phrased in a way as if any other place in the world sucks in comparison, which is ridiculous, but turns out I followed his advice anyway) because I stayed at an apartment in Williamsburg, I also had 2 roommates, with whom I ironically couldn&#39;t spend as much time as I wanted to as I was so busy meeting up with all those other people, I also visited the Etsy and Vimeo offices (both are awesome) and met up with Dave Reisner (who is one of our latest Arch Linux devs, and who lives in NJ, but don&#39;t tell anyone) and who forgot to show me around in the Google office ;-)  And I realize some of the past sentences are a bit long and busy but that&#39;s one of the things I learned at New York I guess.  For one week, I almost lived like a real New Yorker, and it was interesting (but exhausting).

&lt;h3 style=&#34;clear: left;&#34;&gt;Move to Ghent&lt;/h3&gt;

Enough about the trips.  Back to daily life.  I moved to the city of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent&#34;&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;.  Riding by bike to work every day along the scenic &lt;a href=&#34;http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupure_%28Gent%29&#34;&gt;Coupure&lt;/a&gt; is fun.
I am quite proud to say nearly all of my stuff in this apartment is second hand and I&#39;ve been lucky to receive some free stuff as well (thanks Bram!).  Not (only) because I&#39;m &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:line-through&#34;&gt;cheap&lt;/span&gt; money conscious but I like to give things a second life instead of buying something new, lowering the impact on the environment. Even if it doesn&#39;t look too well, as long as it&#39;s functional.  And this is exactly one of those values I mentioned above which is often not understood in our Western society but I was pleased to find out this philosophy is the standard in large parts of Thai culture.

We&#39;ve done 3 gigs (which had great reception, luckily) and we&#39;ve got planned a few already for 2012, one of which will be at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pages/From-Rock-Till-Core/141364465969247&#34;&gt;From Rock Till Core festival&lt;/a&gt; in Merelbeke.
We also did a semi-professional &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/album_promoshoot_summer_2011&#34;&gt;photo-shoot&lt;/a&gt;, and I made a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightbulbinferno.com/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (you can tell I&#39;m not a designer).
&lt;br style=&#34;clear: left;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That wraps up 2011 for me. Good times.. Happy new year everybody!

      <title>Hitchhiking.. try it.</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/hitchhiking_try_it/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 16:04:45 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>hitchhiking_try_it</guid>
      <description>For the last few months, I&#39;ve started to actively use hitchhiking as a means to
travel between home and work.
What started as a &#34;I&#39;m not sure about this, it seems a bit awkward, but I do
want to know how it goes and feels, so I&#39;ll try it out once&#34; ended up being &#34;this is
great, I&#39;m doing it every day and loving it&#34;.
Here&#39;s why you should try it and why it may make your life more awesome.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do I do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet new interesting people.  I meet a lot of different people with all kinds of
  backgrounds.  Male, female.  Young, old.  Native Belgians, immigrants,
students, anything from &#34;lower class&#34; people, to people with regular jobs to even some people with very exciting
lives and/or high profile jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s better for the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save time and/or money.  For me, traveling to/from work by hitchhiking is
  quicker than going by public transport (bus).  Bonus points because my route
involves a pleasant bike ride to the highway entry where I start my little
adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No concerns about parking and/or paying for gas.  My job is near the
  highway exit so usually I get dropped off literally in front of the building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why do people take you with them?&lt;/h3&gt;
From what I can tell:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They like to do something nice, it makes them feel like a better person
  (rightly so).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are bored in the car and would like some companionship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of compassion.  &#34;poor guy must be standing here for a long time&#34;,
  which is rarely true, and I think compassion is not needed, but hey.
  Some drivers told me &#34;I did the same when I was a student so I know it feels
  like&#34;.  Most folks are surprised though when I tell them I do it because I
like to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concern that something bad will happen to you. Which I also think is not
  really needed, but hey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curiosity, they want to hear your story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why you should try it&lt;/h3&gt;
What I learned is, not only can hitchhiking bring you to work faster than by
public transport and/or in a less polluting manner, it can be a fun experience for both you and person
picking you up.  Indeed, some people that pick me up never picked anybody up before
and tell me at the end they were happy they did it, and you can tell their day is made.
Also, avoiding routine makes your days more memorable and interesting.
Btw, I recently stumbled on &lt;a
href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/5800954/escape-the-rut-of-your-daily-routine-by-trying-something-new-for-30-days&#34;&gt;this
presentation&lt;/a&gt;, which tells you how you can make your daily life more
interesting and memorable by trying out new things, the video fits this post
well :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you can have bad luck (no pick up, traffic jam, ...).  It helps if
  you have flexible working hours like me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some good card boards with your destination clearly written.  If you live in a small
  village like me, write down the name of a bigger city which is in the same
direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a spot where drivers have time to see you, have some time to read your
  cardboard and to make up their mind about whether or not to pick you up and then have enough room
to legally put their car to allow you to get in.  All this without endangering
other people in traffic.  When going to work I can stand just at the entry to the highway,
where not that many cars pass, but I have an almost guaranteed pickup within 5
minutes because drivers have time to react.  Whereas when going from work back home, I have no choice but to stand
at a very busy section where drivers have little time to react (avg pickup time there
is 10 minutes or a bit more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look decently dressed. People tell me they felt okay picking me up
  because I look civilized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re a girl, it could be trickier because you could feel uncomfortable
  with some people who pick you up.  That said, I think there are many more people with good
intentions then bad, and you can always say &#34;no thanks&#34; and wait for the next
ride.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Note: this article is not accurate anymore.  I have since moved to Ghent, where
I go to work by bike, but that&#39;s material for a future post.

      <title>My metal band</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/my_metalband/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2011 14:58:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>my_metalband</guid>
      <description>&lt;img width=&#34;18%&#34; src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/pdp3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 28px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the audience of this blog is largely technical, I don&#39;t post much about other topics, but I feel it&#39;s time for a short summary about one of my &#34;real life projects&#34;.
&lt;br/&gt;In the spring of 2009 I joined a progressive death metal band.  I&#39;ve been drumming since I was 17, but during the last 2 years I&#39;ve been practising and rehearsing like never before.[1]
&lt;br/&gt;When you hear yourself on tape for the first time, it&#39;s a bit of disillusionment as you suddenly hear every imperfection, many of which you didn&#39;t realise you had (or didn&#39;t think were very noticeable).
&lt;br/&gt;So 2 years of practicing, rehearsing, test recordings, real recordings, mixing sessions (where you really grow a good ear towards imperfections) later we are now getting to the point where we can nail our stuff and are looking very forward to our first gig, which will be June 3rd in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jhsjatoo.org/&#34;&gt;jh sjatoo&lt;/a&gt; in Kalken.
We&#39;ve written about 7 songs, of which at this point we play 5. I wish we had proper recordings of all of them, but &#34;Total Annihilation&#34; captures several aspects of our style:
&lt;object height=&#34;225&#34; width=&#34;65%&#34;&gt; &lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2762471&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;embed allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2762471&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;65%&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; &lt;/object&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In early 2010 I treated myself (found a nice 2nd hand deal) to a new pdp birch kit with Zildjian Z custom cymbals (that was actually at the time I was in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/not_working_for_facebook.html&#34;&gt;interview process for a Palo-Alto position at Facebook&lt;/a&gt; so I might have needed to sell it again soon after, but that didn&#39;t happen).
&lt;br/&gt; Here are some pics:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/pdp1.jpg&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/pdp2.jpg&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/pdp3.jpg&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/pdp4.jpg&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.
More info about the band:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/lightbulbinferno&#34;&gt;Lightbulb Inferno on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (has some more pictures of the band, but not very good ones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/lightbulb-inferno/&#34;&gt;Lightbulb Inferno on Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myspace.com/lightbulbinferno&#34;&gt;Lightbulb Inferno on Myspace (I know..)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
[1] Hence the need I had to find &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/handing_off_uzbl_to_a_new_project_leader.html&#34;&gt;a new maintainer for Uzbl&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can we build a simple, cross-distribution installation framework?</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/can_we_build_a_simple_cross-distribution_installation_framework/</link>

      <description>Today at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fosdem.org/2011/&#34;&gt;Fosdem 2011&lt;/a&gt; I did my talk &lt;a href=&#34;http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall&#34;&gt;Can we build a simple, cross-distribution installation framework?&lt;/a&gt;
Basically, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt; Installation Framework as a starting point, along with the notion that most of the code is actually not Arch-specific I adressed other distros to check
if there was any interest in sharing workload on the distribution-agnostic aspects of the framework. If other distros with a similar philosophy of little-abstractions/KISS would join, we would all reap the benefits of a simple, yet quite featureful installer.
There was some interest, so we&#39;ll see what happens.

      <title>Dir 2011, Fosdem 2011</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/dir_fosdem_2011/</link>

      <description>On February 4, I&#39;ll be in Amsterdam at &lt;a href=&#34;http://ilps.science.uva.nl/dir2011/cfp.html&#34;&gt;DIR 2011&lt;/a&gt;, the 11th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop.
After that, I&#39;m going to the devopsdinner and Fosdem beer event in Brussels.
On february 5/6 of course, Fosdem itself.  Looking forward to the systemd talk.
On sunday I&#39;ll do a talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/distro_crossinstall&#34;&gt;simple shell based Gnu/Linux installers&lt;/a&gt;,
like mentioned earlier I hope devs from other &#34;lightweight&#34;/kiss-style distro&#39;s will be present (Gentoo and other *too&#39;s, Crux, *ppix, ... You know who you are)
It would be interesting to share some common codebase for distribution independent topics (like filesystems), or at least discuss how feasible it would be.

      <title>Building a search engine</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/building_a_search_engine/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2011 19:15:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>building_a_search_engine</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started working at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibcn.intec.ugent.be/&#34;&gt;IBCN&lt;/a&gt;, the research group of the university of Ghent.
I was looking to get back to the challenging world of high-performance and large-scale (web) applications, but I also wanted something more conceptual and researchy, rather then the highly hands-on dev- and ops work I&#39;ve been doing for a few years now.
&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.ibbt.be/bom-vl/&#34;&gt;Bom-vl&lt;/a&gt; project is pretty broad: it aims to make the Flemish cultural heritage media more useable by properly digitizing, archiving and making public the (currently mostly analog) archives from providers such as TV stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/blog/ibbt/ilabt2.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I believe there&#39;s some &gt;100TB of media in our cluster (mostly from VRT, afaik), along with associated textual descriptions/metadata, with more to follow.  The application is currently for a selected audience but the goal is to make it public in the near future.
I&#39;m part of the search engine team, we aim to provide users with the most relevant hits for their queries, by using existing technology (think Lucene, hadoop, etc) or devising our own where needed.
As I&#39;m charged with a similarity search problem (&#34;other videos which might also interest you&#34;), I&#39;m studying information retrieval topics such as index and algorithm design and various vector models. Starting next week, I&#39;ll probably start implementing and testing some approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back from Canada, Archcon</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/back_from_canada_archcon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2010 23:10:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>87 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back from Canada/Archcon, and it was great. I&#39;ve been in Toronto for 11 days, and visited Montreal for 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Archcon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archcon was small (20-ish people).  (That&#39;s what you get for doing it in Canada ;), but very nice.&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting talks, informal, good vibe, decent logistics and catering.&lt;br /&gt;
This year it happened because Dusty and Ricardo actually just wanted to have a conference without worrying too much about the attendance,&lt;br /&gt;
next year we should do it again because Arch (conferences) rock(s), and because we need more visitors.  More central locations such as Seattle and Europe have been suggested.&lt;br /&gt;
Either way, next year both Judd (founder) and Aaron (current overlord) should be there. (this year they both had lame excuses like family reunions and &#34;almost getting married&#34;.  Congrats btw, Aaron!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an absolute pleasure to meet some more of my fellow devs, and users.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a pic from the group (unfortunately, a few are missing)&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/group.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
People in bold are Arch (ex-) devs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard (sokuban) from Toronto (linguistics student)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris (Gallow) from Toronto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex (alexmat) from Tokyo, Japan (very into NILFS, submitted already some patches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sander (GogglesGuy) (Dutch guy living in the states now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric from Seattle, WA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gregory (gelendir) from Quebec city, Canada (aka dude wearing the kilt and fivefingers and funny accent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin (kpiche)&lt;/b&gt; from Ottawa (does perl stuff iirc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loui (louipc)&lt;/b&gt; from Toronto, Canada (AUR guy, git lover.  metalfan.  Shook John Petrucci&#39;s hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim from Annapolis (uses Arch for servers at work with some fancy mass-install scripts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dustin (daking) from Stanford, CA (runs most of Stanford university on Arch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt; from Belgium (arch-releng/aif, uzbl guy) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walter from Toronto (very into Uzbl, not actually an Arch user... yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David (davekong) from New York City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dan (toofishes)&lt;/b&gt; from Chicago (Pacman dev)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dusty&lt;/b&gt; from Shaunavon SK (shwag, archcon organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ricardo (ralvez) from  Toronto (archcon organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason (Xentac)&lt;/b&gt; from Victoria, BC (entrepeneur, used to use Arch for the business)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=101692&#34;&gt;Archcon thread&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I barely slept the night before my AIF talk, so I feel that one didn&#39;t go to well.  Although people told me it was OK.&lt;br /&gt;
The Uzbl talk was pretty much what I imagined it to be: like the fosdem talk, but a bit more in depth here and there.&lt;br /&gt;
My pc was behaving weirdly, but luckily I could use Dan&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been lucky that Walter and Isaac had proper, respectively videotaping and photocamera equipment.  So there are plenty of pics, and nearly all talks got videotaped.&lt;br /&gt;
(I think the &#34;hacking pacman&#34; one was the only one not being videotaped, because 2 other talks were going on at the same time.  Too bad, it was a very interesting talk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.ca/archcon2010/images/&#34;&gt;Archcon pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.ca/archcon2010/videos/&#34;&gt;Archcon videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My slides:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/aif-archcon2010.pdf&#34;&gt;AIF (day 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/uzbl-archcon2010.pdf&#34;&gt;Uzbl (day 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts and notes of what I did and saw around Toronto/Montreal..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities with streets and subways in a grid layout are awesome.  Soo much easier to navigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red lights with countdown timers (in seconds) are awesome.  Although I&#39;m told some places in Europe have them too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toronto was awesome: huge city, many friendly people, low crime rate, many different cultures, very short history.  High park was very nice. &lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/blog/toronto.ca/high_park_004_500.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Montreal was like a European city: more history, old buildings, more crime, but of course a grid layout.  Some nice views though (ie. from Mont Royal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The youth hostels I went too were great: never got to meet so many interesting people in such a short timespan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CN tower: I procrastinated visiting until the last day, and when I finally wanted to go in the wheather was perfect, but there was a 2 hour queue, so I skipped it. Anyway there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower&#34;&gt;plenty of pictures online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Niagara falls were beautiful.  Maid of the myst tour was worth it.  I made pictures but &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niagara_falls_panorama.jpg&#34;&gt;those online&lt;/a&gt; are better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met Kan Johar (founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://plurk.com&#34;&gt;plurk.com&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others), good times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dusty introduced me to poutine.  I found it disgusting.  I guess you need to be a Canadian before you can like it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/poutine.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dusty and I have been to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://linuxcaffe.ca/&#34;&gt;Linux Caffe.&lt;/a&gt;  The owner is a great guy, he&#39;s considering switching to Arch, and he wrote his whole point of sales, accounting and bookkeeping software using shell scripts, perltk and stuff.  He&#39;s into suckless.org stuff.   His version 2.0 will probably be based on Xmonad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/linuxcaffe-pos1.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/files/linuxcaffe-pos2.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusty and me, somewhere on our way to the Niagara falls.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Off to Toronto July 14-28, Archcon</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/off_to_toronto_july_14-28_archcon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2010 11:34:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>86 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/uzbl_monitoring_aif_talks&#34;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ll be at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/&#34;&gt;Archcon in Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s a very small conference, and the first of its kind.  At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dieter.plaetinck.be/froscon_2009_afterthoughts&#34;&gt;last FrOSCon&lt;/a&gt; we have been playing with the idea to hold an informal Arch conference in Europe, but those were just ideas.  Dusty and Ricardo beat us with an actual implementation.&lt;br /&gt;
This is great, and one of the milestones in Arch Linux history.  Which is why I want to be there and help making it better.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/?p=116&#34;&gt;Archcon schedule&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll be talking about AIF and uzbl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wed. July 14: departure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 14 - 21: hanging around in downtown Toronto. Not sure yet where I&#39;ll stay. probably some hostel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 21 - 28: bed and breakfast pretty close to the conference location, outside the city center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 22 - 23 are the conference talks days, July 24-25 are the conference tourist days, where we&#39;ll do some touristy stuff with the conference participants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wed. July 28: flying back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archcon_extra_activities&#34;&gt;many things to do&lt;/a&gt; in and around Toronto. We still need to make the planning, but the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls&#34;&gt;Niagara Falls&lt;/a&gt; are definitely on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, big thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elys.com/home/&#34;&gt;Elysium Digital&lt;/a&gt;, a technology oriented consulting company for legal matters. Apparently they use Arch Linux for many things: on the desktop, in the server room, and in the forensic lab.   They emailed me to propose sponsoring my plane tickets, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uzbl, monitoring, AIF talks</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/uzbl_monitoring_aif_talks/</link>

      <guid>84 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently did two talks, for which the videos are now online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uzbl.org/news.php?id=25&#34;&gt;Uzbl lightningtalk @ fosdem 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source Monitoring tools lightning talk @ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kangaroot-showcase.be/&#34;&gt;Kangaroot showcase&lt;/a&gt; 2009.  This one is password protected.  If you were a participant, you should have received the pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I&#39;ll be at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/&#34;&gt;ArchCon&lt;/a&gt; this summer, where I&#39;ll be doing these talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/?p=67&#34;&gt;AIF: The Arch Installation Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.ca/archcon2010/?p=73&#34;&gt;Uzbl &amp; web interface tools which adhere to the unix philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas in the fosdem talk I had to focus a lot of information into a short timeslot, here I&#39;ll elaborate a bit more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not sure yet if those talks will get videotaped.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Not working for Facebook</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/not_working_for_facebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2010 22:58:31 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>82 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In november last year, I was contacted by Facebook HR.&lt;br /&gt;
They found my background interesting and thought I might be a good&lt;br /&gt;
fit for an &#34;application operations engineer&#34; position in Palo Alto, California. (it is&lt;br /&gt;
basically the link between their infrastructure engineering and operations/support&lt;br /&gt;
teams).&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did a few technical interviews over phone with other app ops and engineers&lt;br /&gt;
from CA (about the Linux kernel, lowlevel userspace, mysql, memcached, networking, programming,&lt;br /&gt;
scalability, etc) and solved one of their optimisation puzzles.&lt;br /&gt;
( I picked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=2&#34;&gt;usr bin crash&lt;/a&gt;.  Actually I wanted to do something with &lt;a
href=&#34;http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/&#34;&gt;thrift&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a
href=&#34;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-thrift-user/200911.mbox/%3C20091122202901.1f425b7f@plaetinck.be%3E&#34;&gt;I
couldn&#39;t get it to compile&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;br/&gt;The technical interviews went well but then I had&lt;br /&gt;
another interview which was about handling support.  As I have no experience&lt;br /&gt;
in setting up support frameworks and procedures to hand off to separate&lt;br /&gt;
support teams, I was/am not good enough for this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they suggested a role as site reliability engineer for the office in Dublin, which is more about&lt;br /&gt;
troubleshooting, monitoring and systems management/automation.&lt;br /&gt;
So I did some more interviews with SRE&#39;s and engineers from the London office and&lt;br /&gt;
from Palo Alto.  Similar subjects as before, but with more of an operations/support touch to it.&lt;br /&gt;
These also went well, except the last one, which was more about things less related to&lt;br /&gt;
high-performance/scalability such as nfs, pam and ldap.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I missed too many questions on the last interview.  I could come up&lt;br /&gt;
with some excuses such as me being tired (it was the evening before our &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.kangaroot-showcase.be/&#34;&gt;Kangaroot showcase&lt;/a&gt; event, and&lt;br /&gt;
the call being late - Facebook HR messed up a timezone conversion) but fact&lt;br /&gt;
of the matter is: I have little experience with such &#34;office ;-)&#34; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after 8 interviews over phone (each one about 40-60 minutes), spanning&lt;br /&gt;
about 2 months, they let me know they would not go forward with me.&lt;br /&gt;
That was late december, I asked for some feedback but haven&#39;t heard from&lt;br /&gt;
them since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottomline: it sounded quite nice but I&#39;m pretty &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html&#34;&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt; with my current life in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About the maemo summit 2009 and the nokia n900</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/about_the_maemo_summit_2009_and_the_nokia_n900/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2009 21:20:39 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>77 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m back from the 3-day &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009&#34;&gt;maemo summit&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam.  It was very nice.  Very well organized, and Nokia definitely invested enough in catering, fancy-suited people and such to please all 400 of us.  I met several interesting people, both from the community, as well as Nokia guys.&lt;br /&gt;
The talks were diverse, but interesting (duh?).  I will especially remember the kickoff with its fancy visual effects and loud music that set the mood straight for the entire weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
The best moment was, of course, when it was announced that &lt;strong&gt;every summit participant would receive a n900.  Uncontrolled hapiness all around. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had been hoping to buy/preorder the device at the event, with maybe a nice reduction.  But I didn&#39;t dare to hope on getting a device in my hands just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this work?&lt;br /&gt;
Basically, all summit attendees were offered the following deal (I don&#39;t think anyone passed it).  I paraphrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;User gets to use n900 preproduction model until end of April 2010 or earlier if Nokia wants so.&lt;br /&gt;
User provides feedback to Nokia in any form, which Nokia gets ownership of.&lt;br /&gt;
User may not copy/reverse engineer/decompile device/material/software.  But other then that he can fully use it, hack (on) it and share information about it.&lt;br /&gt;
No warranty or any form of compensation if the device blows up your house, breaks your arm, or submits your personal data to pastebin.com&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely fair enough I would say.  I&#39;ll surely stick to my end of the deal and provide them a good dose of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experiences?  Here are the main things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the hardware is definitive, the software probably isn&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meets all expectations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete debian-based mini-pc which fits in pocket easily.  A screen (800x480) which shows normal webpages just fine, no need for smaller pages.  Typing on keyboard is a lot slower then on a netbook.  For me the device could have been bigger so I could do 10-finger typing (I would call using a headset anyway), but I&#39;m sure many people like the small formfactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A userland we are used to: glibc, sysvinit, dbus, gstreamer, bluez, gtk, HAL, apt, and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very nice and easy UI, high performance multitasking, 3D, many nice details seem to be implemented just when you need them, ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not just a &#34;OS + apps&#34; but everything can be (and usually is) integrated: i.e. contact book with the various means to reach a contact (jabber/sms/skype/cellular call/..).  when you call someone it will choose skype or cellular, whichever is best. (this probably expands to SIP and whichever means more applications will bring).  Contacts with birthdays show up in the calendar, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quite smooth UI. Sometimes a bit of stutter in multitask view when closing or switching apps (but hey, nothing my real PC doesn&#39;t do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many features for such a small form factor.  The hardware feels &#34;done&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery lasts long enough.   About 30 hours for light to medium use on a new device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slight nuisances, mostly with the software:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The microB browser needs some polishing.  It hangs when the wifi goes away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lack of consistency in UI across maemo interface and various apps (scrolling behaviour is sometimes different, &#34;just start typing to initiate search&#34; doesn&#39;t apply everywhere) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to open back cover and to remove battery &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell (ash) history does not (always?) get saved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tools such as less, sed, curl, awk, ... by default.  No packages for them yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maps application feels incomplete.  It&#39;s not a navigation system like Tomtom (and a Nokia guy told me they aren&#39;t aiming for that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It continously tries looking for network when it can&#39;t find any, even though I keep saying no&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m keeping a detailed list of all issues I encounter, which I&#39;ll report on the bugtracker.&lt;br /&gt;
Until now all issues I found are small, and most are fixable in a short timespan so I think the &#34;real&#34; devices will be there soon.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m definitely looking forward playing more with it and hacking it.&lt;br /&gt;
And most of all, I think I will actually begin trusting this device enough to maintain my contacts, calendar, .. and to actually use the features it brings (instead of for example ssh&#39;ing to home and chatting from there)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great work Nokia, you guys rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** update: 13-10-2009: updated the battery uptime number to 30 hours.  I measured it for real this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>nokia n900 &amp; maemo summit 2009</title>
      <link>http://dieter.plaetinck.be/post/nokia_n900_and_maemo_summit_2009/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2009 17:40:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>76 at http://dieter.plaetinck.be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=580045&#34;&gt;&#34;perfect mobile companion device&#34;&lt;/a&gt; already for a while.  Basically I want a &#34;pocket PC that can do as much as possible over which i have as much control as possible so I can do things my way, but still fits in a pocket and which can do gsm and such&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
So, something like a netbook, but really portable, and that can also do telephony stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
Nokia&#39;s recently announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/&#34;&gt;n900&lt;/a&gt; seems to be very close to what I&#39;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;
It could have been a tad bigger (to make typing easier) but other then that it looks perfect: powerful, high resolution display, Linux with a &#34;usual&#34; userspace (unlike Android) to give me all freedom I&#39;m looking for, keyboard, plenty of space and many goodies such as wifi, a-gps, fm receiver/transmitter, IR, bluetooth, digital camera, tv-out and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device has ignited my interest in Maemo and all things related so I&#39;ll be in Amsterdam on October 9-10-11, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009&#34;&gt;Maemo summit 2009&lt;/a&gt;.  I was lucky enough to score a place in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/hotel-1556-ibis-amsterdam-centre/index.shtml&#34;&gt;ibis hotel Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, as Nokia has reserved more rooms then they could fill with invited speakers and own personnel ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m hoping it will be possible to buy a device at the conference.  The timing would be perfect.  Nokia seems to be a really cool company and so far, they haven&#39;t disappointed yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related: a &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.maemo.org/Mer&#34;&gt;Mer (maemo alternative)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://gitorious.org/~lbt&#34;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; told me he was very interested in making &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uzbl.org/&#34;&gt;uzbl&lt;/a&gt; available on Mer, so he did just that. I&#39;m curious myself how usable uzbl will be on the n900. Only one way to find out :)&lt;/p&gt;
