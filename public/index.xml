      <description>For nearly a decade, while I dedicated myself to building out Grafana Labs and subsequently took some personal time to recuperate from said dedication, this blog has withered through neglect. I came out of these experiences as a different person, and am ready to share a few things I learned.
Meanwhile, I have also started some new projects I&amp;rsquo;ld like to share.
Updated hugo to the latest version, found a new theme, let&amp;rsquo;s go.</description>
