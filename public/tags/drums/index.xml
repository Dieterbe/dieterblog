      <description>I recorded a little drumvideo while practicing.
It&#39;s just some improvisation... Find the mistakes! ;-)
Recorded with 2 shure SM57&#39;s, an M-audio mobilepre USB and the iSight cam in my macbook pro.
The mic setup had to be close enough to sound direct and focused without too much reverb, and still far enough to allow all instruments too come through. After some experimenting I decided to place the mics behind the kit, next to me ( one each side), just below the height of the hips.</description>
