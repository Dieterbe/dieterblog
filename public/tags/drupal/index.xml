      <description>pyblosxom is a pretty cool blogging platform written in python.
Like many of the modern minimal blog engines it works with plaintext files only (no database), has a relatively small codebase, supports many plugins (like markdown support), is written in a proper scripting language, has a simple and clean file structure, is seo-friendly, and so on.
The one feature that sets it apart from other minimal blog engines is that it supports comments, and doesn&#39;t just rely on an external service like disqus, but stores comments as plaintext files as well.</description>
