      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m back from the 3-day &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009&#34;&gt;maemo summit&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam.  It was very nice.  Very well organized, and Nokia definitely invested enough in catering, fancy-suited people and such to please all 400 of us.  I met several interesting people, both from the community, as well as Nokia guys.&lt;br /&gt;
The talks were diverse, but interesting (duh?).  I will especially remember the kickoff with its fancy visual effects and loud music that set the mood straight for the entire weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
The best moment was, of course, when it was announced that &lt;strong&gt;every summit participant would receive a n900.  Uncontrolled hapiness all around. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>I have been looking for the &#34;perfect mobile companion device&#34; already for a while. Basically I want a &#34;pocket PC that can do as much as possible over which i have as much control as possible so I can do things my way, but still fits in a pocket and which can do gsm and such&#34;
So, something like a netbook, but really portable, and that can also do telephony stuff.</description>
