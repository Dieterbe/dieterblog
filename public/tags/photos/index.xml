      <description>A post about the magnificent darktable photo manager/editor and why I&#39;m abandoning pixie When I wrote pixie, I was aware of darktable. It looked like a neat application with potential to be pretty much what I was looking for, although it also looked complicated, mainly due to terminology like &#34;darkroom&#34; and &#34;lighttable&#34;, which was a bit off-putting to me and made me feel like the application was meant for photo professionals and probably wouldn&#39;t work well with the ideals of a techie with some purist views on how to manage files and keep my filesystems clean.</description>
