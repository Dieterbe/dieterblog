      <description>I have a one-way ticket to NYC on Sept. 21st. Vimeo HQ is in Manhattan, and practically the whole team works in the building so it makes sense for me to relocate and join them locally. I&#39;m looking forward to working with the colleagues face to face, but mainly I&#39;m looking forward to the experience of living in such a different place, and exploring the US. In fact, I already have some small trips planned (Hamptons NY, camping in Pennsylvania, skiing in New York this winter) with some friends I met last year in NY.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to write about a lot of stuff in separate posts, but they kept getting delayed, so I&#39;ll just briefly share everything in one post.
